<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        <b>What is Energy?</b> Energy in general is a measure of the <i><b>motion</b></i> of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two general categories of energy that objects may have: <b>Kinetic energy</b> and
        <b>Potential energy</b>.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion. The faster an object is moving, the more
          kinetic energy it has. For example, an electron that is moving faster has more kinetic energy than a
          slower-moving electron.
        </li>
        <li>
          Potential energy is related to the amount of motion an object can have (in the future) because it is being acted on by
          a <b>net</b> force. (If you don't know what "net force" means, <a class="brm-link" href="../net-force/" target="_blank">click here</a>.)
          For example, electrons are pulled by protons toward the nucleus of atoms. Because of this,
          electrons have the "potential" to move even faster.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">

      <b>Types of Kinetic Energy</b><br/>
     <br/>

          <b>Kinetic energy</b> is the energy of an object (including atoms and molecules!) that is due to the object’s
          motion. Because there are different types of motion, there are different types of kinetic energy. 
          
          
          When people use the term "kinetic energy," they are most likely referring to the <i>translational</i> kinetic
          energy of an object. The translational kinetic energy of an object is the kinetic energy of the object
          due to the object as a whole moving <i>across</i> some distance.

        <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The (translational) <b>Kinetic energy</b> of an object is proportional to its mass and the square of
          its speed (or velocity). Specifically:
          <span style="background-color:rgb(0,255,255)"><b>KE</b> = ½<b>m*v<sup>2</sup></b></span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          In these units, if we say "kinetic energy," we mean "translational kinetic energy." If we mean another type
          of kinetic energy, we will say what that other kind of kinetic energy is (e.g., "rotational kinetic energy").
        </p>

        <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Below are some examples of <b>translational motion</b>, where the object as a whole moves across a distance:</li>
      </ul>

      <br/>
      <img alt="Image showing example of translational motion" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="TranslationalMotion_final.png"/>
      <br/>

<p>In each case, the (translational) kinetic energy of the object can be calculated from its mass and its speed/velocity (KE = ½m*v<sup>2</sup>).</p>


</div>

<div class="page" id="page3">

<b>Other types of kinetic energy</b>

      <ul class="brm-list">
      <li> A second type of kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to <b>rotational motion</b>, where an object rotates on an axis. An example of this is the Earth rotating on its axis, causing 
      day and night. This type of motion is shown below:

<img alt="Image showing examples of rotational motion" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="RotationalMotion.png"/>


        <li>
        A final type of kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to <b>vibrational motion.</b> For this type of motion,
        again the object as a <i>whole</i> does not move through space. Instead, it moves kind of like an accordion. A
        person playing an accordion can stand still while playing it because it has no translational motion.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-centered">An example of vibrational motion is shown below.</p>

      
        <img class="img-centered img-size_med" height="148" src="VibrationalMotion.GIF"/>
      
      <br/>
<p>
        In the example above, the "object" is composed of two boxes and a spring between them. The boxes both move
        away from each other, then back toward each other (like the accordion). But the middle of the spring (the
        "center of mass") does not move in space. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Carbon dioxide is one molecule that absorbs energy from sunlight, which is converted into vibrational motion
        of the molecules.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Rotational kinetic energy (KE)</b>: As we said before, an object can have other types of kinetic energy besides
          translational KE. Rotational kinetic energy is the energy due to the object spinning around an
          axis (including rolling on the ground). 
        </li>
      </ul>




      <div style="text-align: center">

        <img alt="Earth Axis" class="center img-size_200" src="SpinningSphere.png"/>
        <br/>
      </div>





      <ul>
        <li>
          In general, rotational
          <b>KE</b> = ½<b>I </b> • <b>ω</b><sup>2</sup>
          . (This looks similar to
          <b>KE</b> = ½<b>m</b> • <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>
          , right?) I is like the mass of the object, but it’s the resistance of the object’s mass to
          <i>rotational</i> motion (rather than translational motion). And ω is the rotational speed of
          the object or how fast the object rotates on its axis (rather than translational speed).
        </li>
      </ul>



      <ul>
        <li>
          If a solid ball is rolling across a surface, it will have BOTH translational KE <i>and</i>
          rotational KE. Again, the rotational KE is in general equal to: ½ <b>I</b> • <b>ω</b><sup>2</sup>.
        </li>
      </ul>



      <ul>
        <li>
          For a solid sphere, <b>I</b> = (2/5)<b>m</b> • <b>r</b><sup>2</sup> (you
          need to look up values of I for different shapes of objects)
        </li>
      </ul>



      <ul>
        <li>
          This relationship indicates that I, the resistance to spinning, increases with both the mass (m)
          of the sphere and with the square of the radius of the sphere. (So, smaller spheres resist
          spinning less than larger spheres, which is intuitive, right?)
        </li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ω</b> is related to the translational speed of the sphere (if it is rolling without slipping on
          the surface at all) as follows: <b>ω</b> = <b>v/r</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>
          This is because when an object rolls one revolution, or 360 degrees — which is equal to 2
          <span class="font-times">π</span> radians (trust us for now) — it will
          travel a distance equal to the circumference of the sphere, 2
          <span class="font-times">π</span><b>r</b> (where <b>r</b> is the radius of the
          sphere) or <span class="font-times">π</span><b>d</b>(where <b>d</b> is the
          diameter of the sphere). 
        </li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>
          So,
          <b>KE<sub>R</sub></b> = (2/5) m • <b class="text-lg">r</b><sup>2</sup> × (<b>v/r</b>)<sup>2</sup>
          <span class="text-xxl">→</span>
          the r’s will cancel out, so we get for the rotational KE of a sphere: 
          <span style="background-color:rgb(0,255,0)">
            KE<sub>R</sub> = 2/5 m • v<sup><b>2</b></sup>

        <b>Potential energy </b>is the <i>potential</i> for an object to move faster (or accelerate) because a
        <b>net</b> force
        is acting on the object. For example, an object such as a rock at the top of a
        cliff (right before it starts to fall) has potential energy because the downward force of gravity will make it
        fall (and gain a lot of kinetic energy,
        if it's high enough!). 
      </p>


      The potential energy of an object due to gravity (when no other forces act on the object) depends on three
      variables: 



      <ul>
        <li>the mass of the object (m)</li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>the acceleration due to gravity (g) (on Earth, g is about 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>), </li>
      </ul>


      <ul>
        <li>and its height above the ground (h).</li>
      </ul>


      <br/>



      As each of these variables increases, the potential energy of the object increases. This is shown in the
      equation below:



      <ul>
        <li>The potential energy of an object (due to gravity) = <b>m</b> x <b>g</b> x <b>h</b></li>

          Yes! The block is not moving at Time 1, so it has no kinetic energy. But the block has both gravity and the
          force of the
          spring pushing down on it. So it has (lots of) potential energy, or potential to move faster.

          Not quite. The block is not moving at Time 1, so it has no kinetic energy. But the block has both gravity and
          the force of the
          spring pushing down on it. So it has (lots of) potential energy, or potential to move faster.

        <b>Q5b: At Time 2, the block is at its middle point. It is now moving at its maximum speed. At this point, the
          downward
          force of gravity acting on the block is equal to the upward force of the spring on the block. So, there is no
          net force
          acting on the block in the vertical (or any other!) direction.

          Good job! The block is moving at Time 2, so it has kinetic energy. Because there is no net force acting on the
          block at this point,
          the block does not have potential to move any faster. So, its potential energy at this point is zero.

          Yes! The block is not moving at Time 3, so it does not have kinetic energy. However, there is a net force
          acting on the block,
          which will cause its speed to increase. So, there is potential for the block to start moving faster. We say
          the block now "has" potential energy.
