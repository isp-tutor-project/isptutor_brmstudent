    <h1>Kinetic and Potential Energy</h1>

    <div id="page1" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>What is Energy?</b> Energy in general is a measure of the <i><b>motion</b></i> of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two general categories of energy that objects may have: <b>Kinetic energy</b> and
        <b>Potential energy</b>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion. The faster an object is moving, the more
          kinetic energy it has. For example, an electron that is moving faster has more kinetic energy than a
          slower-moving electron.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          Potential energy is the amount of motion an object can have (in the future) because it is being acted on by
          some force. For example, electrons are pulled by protons toward the nucleus of atoms. Because of this,
          electrons have the "potential" to move even faster.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    </div>

    <div id="page2" class="page">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Kinetic energy</b> is the energy of an object (including atoms and molecules!) that is due to the object’s
          motion. Because there are different types of motion, there are different types of kinetic energy. When
          people use the term "kinetic energy," they are most likely referring to the <i>translational</i> kinetic
          energy of an object. <span style="font-family:verdana,sans-serif">The translational kinetic energy of an
          object is the kinetic energy of the object due to the object as a whole moving <i>across</i> some distance
          </span>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The (translational) <b>Kinetic energy</b> of an object is equal to the product of its mass and the square of
          its speed (or velocity):
          <span style="background-color:rgb(0,255,255)"><b>KE</b> = ½<b>m*v<sup>2</sup></b></span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In these units, if we say "kinetic energy," we mean "translational kinetic energy." If we mean another type
          of kinetic energy, we will say what that other kind of kinetic energy is (e.g., "rotational kinetic energy").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Below are some types of translational motion (and one other type of motion):</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

           src="TranslationalMotion.png" alt="Image showing examples of translational motion" width="800" />
      <br />

      <p>
        A final type of non-translational kinetic energy is <b>vibrational motion.</b> For this type of kinetic energy,
        again the object as a <i>whole</i> does not move through space. Instead, it moves kind of like an accordion. A
        person playing an accordion can stand still while playing it because it has no translational motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center">An example of vibrational motion is shown below.</p>

      </a>
      <br />

      <p style="text-align:center">
        In the example above, the "object" is composed of two boxes and a spring between them. The boxes both move
        away from each other, then back toward each other (like the accordion). But the middle of the spring (the
        "center of mass") does not move in space.

        Carbon dioxide is one molecule that absorbs energy from sunlight, which is converted into vibrational motion
        of the molecules.

          The potential energy of the squirrel due to gravity is equal to the product of the squirrel's mass (0.5 kg),
          acceleration due to gravity (about 10 m/s2),
          and the height of the squirrel above the ground (10 m): <br>

        <div class="feedback-correct feedback">
          The potential energy of the squirrel due to gravity is: <br>
          PE = mass*height*g (acceleration due to gravity, about 10 m/s^2)
          <br>
          So, PE = (0.5 kg)*(5 m)*(10 m/s^2) = 25 kg*m^2/s^2

          This is half of the squirrel's PE when it was 10 meters up the tree.
