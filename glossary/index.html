            <dd>
                The temperature at which a liquid substance changes to a gas or vapor substance. At this point, the
                molecules of the liquid
                substance are moving around fast enough to break free from their bonds with other molecules, becoming a
                gaseous substance.
                This point is different for every substance but the most commonly known boiling point is the boiling point
                for water, at
                100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_cause">Cause</dt>
            <dd>
                To make something happen. For example, in a cause and effect relationship, one event causes another to
                happen.
                The cause is why it happened, and the effect is what happened.

            <dd>
                A way to represent a chemical reaction using element symbols (found in the Periodic table). Chemical
                equations have two sides: the
                reactant side and the product side. For example, two oxygen atoms (reactant) may react to form a product: an
                oxygen molecule: O + O -> O2.
            </dd>


            <dt id="glossary_chemical_reaction">Chemical Reaction</dt>
            <dd>
                A process in which substances and their molecules change into other substances with a different set of
                molecules.

                [a sugar called glucose + oxygen].
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_control">Control v.</dt>
            <dd>
                As a verb, control means to make all the variables you are not testing the same across
                the experimental conditions. This way, you can "control" that variable so it does not affect the outcome of
                the experiment.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_control">Control n.</dt>
            <dd>
                As a noun, the control condition is the condition that is the "usual" way things are. For example, if you're
                testing whether
                fertilizer you usually give them. In a medical experiment, the control condition would be people who do not
                take the medicine you're testing.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_correlation">Correlation</dt>
            <dd>
                The relationship between two variables, where increases in one variable are associated with increases or
                decreases in the other
                variable. However, changes in one variable may or may not cause changes in the other variable. For example,
                you may keep a record
                of the temperature and your mood and find that you tend to feel happier on days when the weather is warmer.
                But you can't be sure
                that the outside temperature causes you to feel more or less happy. (Something else could be affecting your
                mood.)
            </dd>

            <dd>
                A special kind of solid material where the molecules "fit" together in a repeating pattern. The repeating
                patterns cause unique shapes. An example of common crystals are sugar and salt.
            </dd>


            <dt id="glossary_crystallization">Crystallization</dt>
            <dd>
                The forming of organized patters of atoms or molecules. For example, to see which type of ice cream people
                prefer, you can count the number of people at an ice cream shop who order chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice
                cream, or vanilla twist ice cream.

            <dd>
                the mass of a substance divided by its volume; (D = m/v) The mass of atoms, their size, and how they are
                arranged determines the density of a substance.
            </dd>

            <dd>
                the variable that might be affected by (or might depend on) the variable that is being tested.
                For example, if you want to know if the amount of light affects plant growth, the change in the plant's
                height is the dependent (or outcome) variable.
            </dd>

                occur.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_energy">Energy</dt>
            <dd>
                In simple terms, energy is related to the amount of motion of an object. When an object moves around faster,

            <dd>
                The process of a liquid substance changing to a gas or vapor,(notice "vapor" in "e-vapor-ate," which means
                to become a vapor).
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_exothermic_reaction">Exothermic reaction</dt>
            <dd>

                The matter in either a liquid of gas state.
                Particles of fluids move around freely and have no fixed shape (they take the shape of the container they
                are in).
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_freezing_point">Freezing Point</dt>
            <dd>
                The temperature at which a liquid becomes a solid. For water, the freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius or 32

            <dd>
                A force that resists motion and is caused by objects rubbing against each other. Anytime two objects rub
                against each other, they cause friction, making objects slow down when sliding on a surface.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_gas">Gas</dt>
            <dd>
                A state of matter where atoms are moving freely, bumping into each other and changing directions. gases have
                no definite shape or volume, and they take the shape of the container they are in.
                For example, think of inflating a balloon. The matter inside the balloon is the gas.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_increase">Increase</dt>
            <dd>

            <dd>
                the variable that is being tested in an experiment. The experimenter changes this to see if it affects an
                outcome.
                For example, you may want to see if the amount of fertilizer affects how tall plants grow. So, the amount of
                fertilizer is the
                independent variable in your experiment. You would need to use different amounts of fertilizer to see if it
                affects plant growth.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_ion">Ion</dt>
            <dd>
                An atom that has either lost or gained one or more electrons, giving the atom a "net" electric charge.
                For example, an atom of Na (sodium) often loses on one electron, making it an ion with a "net" charge of -1.
                This ion is written as Cl-.
                It has a negative charge because it now has one more electron (-) than proton (+).
            </dd>

            <dd>
                A state of matter where the atoms slither past each other like slippery marbles. Although liquids have a
                definite mass and volume, they do not have a definite shape.

            <dd>
                A group of atoms bonded (or held) together. A molecule can be made of atoms of the same
                element, such as O2, or can be made of atoms of different elements, such as H2O. Another example of a
                molecule is NaCl,
                which is made of one Na (sodium) atom and one CL (chlorine) atom.

            <dt id="glossary_photosynthesis">Photosynthesis</dt>
            <dd>
                The process plants use to create food by using light energy, carbon dioxide, and
                water. This process is necessary for growth, and continues throughout the life
                cycle of the plant.

                The equation for photosynthesis is as follows: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This
                means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with six molecules of
                water (H2O) in the presence of light energy to produce a sugar molecule and six
                molecules of oxygen.

            <dt id="glossary_physical_reaction">Physical Reaction</dt>
            <dd>
                This occurs when molecules stay the same (they don’t change into different types of
                molecules), but move to different places.

                For example, a physical reaction occurring would be freezing water into ice, and melting ice to water.
                Another example would be sugar dissolving in water, where the sugar molecules
                break away from the cube and spread into the water.

            <dd>
                The fourth state of matter where particles move even more energetically and freely than
                gas. This occurs when a lot of energy is added to a gas, causing atoms to be highly excitable and breaking
                off their
                outer electron.

            <dt id="glossary_saturation_point">Saturation point</dt>
            <dd>
                The point when you are adding a substance to a liquid when no more of the substance
                can dissolve in the liquid (such as water). For example, if you keep
                adding Kool Aid mix (the solute) to water (the solvent) in a glass, after the
                saturation point, you will notice the mix start building up on the bottom of
                the glass. This is because there is too much mix to dissolve in the water.

            <dt id="glossary_solid">Solid</dt>
            <dd>
                A state of matter where the atoms or particles are tightly packed or vibrate in place. Solids
                have a definite shape, mass, and volume. Examples of materials in
                a solid state at room temperature are rocks, most metals, and ice.

            <dt id="glossary_solubility">Solubility</dt>
            <dd>
                The ability of a substance (the solute), to mix into a liquid (the solvent).
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_solute">Solute</dt>
            <dd>
                A substance that can be dissolved by a solvent to create a solution. A solute can come in many
                forms. It can be gas (such as CO2), liquid, or solid (salt/sugar). For example, when
                dissolving salt in water, the salt (solute) is dissolved in water (solvent) to
                create the salty water (solution).
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_solution">Solution </dt>
            <dd>
                A homogenous mixture, or a mixture in which the solute and solvent are spread out evenly.
                The concentration of the solute is the same throughout the liquid.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_solvent">Solvent</dt>
            <dd>
                The substance (usually a liquid) in which another material dissolves. For example, water is a
                common solvent for chemical and physical reactions.
            </dd>


            <dt id="glossary_states_of_matter">States of matter</dt>
            <dd>
                Matter exists in one of these states: SOLID, LIQUID, GAS or PLASMA. They exist in
                these different states, depending on the temperature of the matter. As
                temperature increases, materials change from solid to liquid to gas states. For example, as the
                temperature of water increases, it can melt from the original ice (solid) to
                water (liquid), and evaporate to vapor (gas). Plasma is higher-energy than the
                other states found on earth and not commonly found.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_stomata">Stomata</dt>
            <dd>
                The pores (little holes or openings) found on the stems, leaves and other plant parts
                that control gases (such as CO2 and O2) moving in and out of the plant. As
                gases filter through the stomata, photosynthesis can take place.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_sublimation">Sublimation</dt>
            <dd>
                The process of solid substance turning into a gaseous state.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_temperature">Temperature</dt>
            <dd>
                In everyday terms, temperature is how hot or cold something is. You measure temperature
                using a thermometer. Scientifically, the temperature of an object has to do
                with how fast its particles (atoms; molecules) are moving around: the
                faster the particles are moving, the higher the object’s temperature is.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_thermal_energy">Thermal energy</dt>
            <dd>
                The total amount of energy of an object that is due to the movement of all of the
                particles that make up the object. You can calculate the thermal energy of an
                object by adding the kinetic energies of all of the particles the object is
                made of.
                <br> So, an object at a high
                temperature has more thermal energy than the same object when it is at a lower
                temperature.
                <br>
                Also, for two objects
                made of the same material that are at the same temperature, the larger object
                will have more thermal energy than the smaller object. This is because it has
                more particles.

            <dt id="glossary_variable">Variable</dt>
            <dd>
                A factor that has different amounts or types (can be VARIED).
                <br>
                For example, "fertilizer" can be a variable, which could be either different amounts or different types.
                You can give your plant different amounts of fertilizers or different types of
                fertilizers.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_values">Values</dt>
            <dd>
                The different amounts or types of a variable.
                <br>
                For example, values of the variable "temperature" include 0&deg; C and 100&deg; C. Or, values of the variable
                "types of music" could be hip hop, country, and rock.
                <br>
                One synonym for "values" is "levels."
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_volume">Volume</dt>
            <dd>
                The amount of space an object takes up. If the object is hollow (or empty), its volume is the
                amount of water it can hold.
            </dd>

            <dt id="glossary_weight">Weight</dt>
            <dd>
                The amount of gravitational force pulling on an object. The weight of an object depends on
                the pull of gravity, and therefore changes depending on where the object is.
