<dt id="<glossary_absorb">
Absorb</dt>
<dd>
When a material takes in a substance or energy. An example of absoprtion is a cotton cloth taking in spilled water or a tar road absorbing sunlight (and becoming hotter). 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_atom">
Atom</dt>
<dd>
The basic unit of matter also known as the "building blocks" of matter. It is made of a nucleus consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_atomic number">
Atomic Number</dt>
<dd>
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. You can identify the element of an atom based on how many protons it has. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_atomic mass">
Atomic Mass</dt>
<dd>
The number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_boiling point">
Boiling Point</dt>
<dd>
The temperature at which a liquid substance changes to a gas or vapor substance. At this point, the molecules of the liquid 
substance are moving raound fast enough to break free from their bonds with other molecules, becoming a gaseous substance. 
This point is different for every substance but the most commonly known boiling point is the boiling point for water, at
100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_buoyancy">
Buoyancy</dt>
<dd>
The ability of an object to float or rise in a fluid (either a liquid or gas).
</dd>


<dt id="<glossary_buoyancy force">
Buoyancy Force</dt>
<dd>
The force that arises from the pressure of the molecules of a fluid (either glas or liquid) pushing on the object in the fluid.
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_catalyst">
Catalyst</dt>
<dd>
A material that speeds up a chemical reaction. An example of a catalyst is an enzyme, produced by living organisms 
to cause a chemical change in the plant or animal. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_cause">
Cause</dt>
<dd>
To make something happen. For example, in a cause and effect relationship, one event causes another to happen. 
The cause is why it happened, and the effect is what happened. 
</dd>

<dt id="<glossary_chemical">
Chemical</dt>
<dd>
A substance that is made of just one type of atom or molecule. For example, water is a chemical, 
made of H2O molecules (two atoms of hydrodgen and one atom of oxygen).
</dd>


<dt id="<glossary_chemical equation">
Chemical Equation</dt>
<dd>
A way to represent a chemical reaction using element symbols (found in the Periodic table). Chemical equations have two sides: the 
reactant side and the product side. For example, two oxygen atoms (reactant) may react to form a product: an oxygen molecule: O + O -> O2. 
</dd>


<dt id="<glossary_chemical reaction">
Chemical Reaction</dt>
<dd>
A process in which substances and their molecules change into other substances with a different set of molecules. 
For example, in photosynthesis, [carbon dioxide + water] react to each other to change into new substances [a sugar called glucose + oxygen].
 </dd>
