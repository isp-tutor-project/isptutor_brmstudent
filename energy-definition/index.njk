<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        <b>First, what is Energy *not*?</b> The idea of energy is confusing to a lot of people. 
        But you need to understand that energy is <u>not</u> a type of substance. It is related to the motion or movement of atoms, molecules, and objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What energy *is*:</b> Energy is an abstract (mathematical) measure related to the amount of motion of objects (including atoms and molecules). Energy can be classified into two general categories: kinetic energy and potential energy. 
        Energy related to motion is called "kinetic energy."
        Energy is also an abstract (mathematical) measure of the potential for <b>more</b> motion. Energy related to the potential for motion is called "potential energy."
      </p>
      <br>
    <div class="text-centered">Two general types of energy:</div>
      <p>
        <b>Kinetic energy:</b> the abstract (mathematical) way to measure an object's kinetic energy due to movement over a distance is:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>KE (of object) = 1/2*(mass of object)*(speed of object)<sup>2</sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So, you can see from this equation that kinetic energy is a measure of the object's motion: speed (as well as
        its mass).
      </p>
      
<p>
        <b>Potential energy:</b> An abstract (mathematical) way to measure an object's potential energy (PE) due to gravity is:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>PE (of object) = (mass of object)*(height of object above the ground)*(acceleration due to gravity or "g")
      </ul>

      <p>So, both measures of energy include the <b>mass</b> of the object that is either moving or has potential to move. It's not 
      obvious for potential energy, but both measures also include the <b>speed of the object</b>. For the potential energy of an object 
      falling in a vacuum, </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
      <li>(height of object above the ground)*(acceleration due to gravity) = 1/2*(speed of object right before it hits the ground)<sup>2</sup>  
     </ul>






So, for an object falling in a vacuum: 

     <ul class="brm-list">
      <li>PE (of object) = 1/2*(mass of object)*(speed of object right before it hits the ground)<sup>2</sup>  
     </ul>
