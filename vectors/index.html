        <b>Vector</b> quantities are variables that have both
            a <u>magnitude</u> (or amount) <i>and</i> a <u>direction</u>.
            Vectors are represented by arrows. The length of the arrow
            represents the magnitude, and the direction the arrow points is
            the direction.<div><br /></div>
            <div>Some examples of vector quantities are:</div>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Force:</b> It has a magnitude (amount of force)
            and direction the force acts on an object. In the
            picture below, the arrows indicate the direction
            that each force acts on the object. The length of
            the arrows represents the magnitude of each force.
            Because the force of gravity acting on the body is
            greater than the other forces, the arrow
            representing the force of gravity is longest.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <div style='display:block;text-align:left'><a
                imageanchor='1'
                href='../../speed-acceleration/vectors/SteepSlopeNew.GIF?attredirects=0/index.html'><img

    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Instantaneous Velocity:</b> This is both the
            <u>speed</u> of an object and the <u>direction</u>
            it is moving at a point in time. The picture below
            shows the instantaneous velocity of a ball at two
            points as it rolls down a hill. When it is at the
            top of the hill, it is moving slower than when it's
            at the bottom of the hill. This is why the arrow is
            longer when the ball is at the bottom of the hill.
            The direction of the arrow is the direction the ball
            is moving at that point in time.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <div style='display:block;text-align:left'><a

                    border='0' /></a></div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Acceleration:</b> This is how quickly an object
            changes in speed and the direction of its change in
            speed. For example, in the picture below, two
            objects are falling downward due to gravity (there
            are no other forces acting on the objects). The
            direction of the arrows indicate that the objects
            are accelerating downward. The arrows are the same
            lengths because the objects accelerate by the same
            amount. (All objects fall with the same acceleration
            if only gravity acts on the objects!)</li>

            style='background-color:transparent'><b>Scalar</b>
            quantities are variables that only have a magnitude
            (or amount); they do not have a direction. Here are
            some examples:</span></div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Volume </b>is just the amount of space an object
                        occupies. (It does not have a direction; how can
                        it?)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mass</b> is the amount of stuff (atoms and
                        molecules) that makes up an object. (It does not
                        have a direction.)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Distance</b> is the length of something or how
                        far something moves. (It doesn't matter the
                        direction(s) that the object traveled.)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Average Speed</b> is just how far an object moves
                        divided by the time it took the object to move that
                        distance. The object might have changed direction
                        many times while it was moving.</li>
