            <h1>Angiosperm Reproduction</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        Angiosperms are flowered plants. They are very important to humans and other animals. They are our
        sources of food, clothing, and medicine. Plants like cotton, sunflowers, vegetables, fruit, as well as trees are
        all examples of important angiosperms. Because of their importance, humans need to understand how angiosperms
        reproduce (so we can help them to reproduce, if necessary).
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture below (left) shows a flower of an angiosperm plant. People
        often just think of the pretty petals as the “flower.” But the flower is much more
        than just its pretty petals! The flower also includes the reproductive parts of angiosperms.
      </p>

      </div>


      <p>
        <b>Reproductive parts of <u>Angiosperms</u>:</b> The flower is the reproductive organ of the Angiosperm. The
        <b>petals</b> are colorful and attract things like insects (like the bee shown above) and birds to help in the
        fertilization
        process. Some flowers have both male and female reproductive parts in them. Some flowers are either male or
        female. The flower shown has both male and female reproductive parts.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">

        <li>
          <b>Stamens (male; note the "men" in "stamen," which can help you remember it's the male part)</b>.
          The entire <i>male</i> parts of the plant’s flower are <b>stamens</b>, which are the
          thin stalks topped with small knobs at the top. The thin stalk is called the <b>filament</b>. The small knobs
          at the top are called <b>anthers</b>, which contain the flower’s <b>pollen</b>. Pollen is a sticky substance
          that is often yellow, orange, or white (in the picture above, you can see pollen grains that are sticking to
          the bee). Each individual pollen grain contains <b>sperm cells.</b>
        </li>

        <img class="img-centered img-size" src="FlowerDiagramRevised_relabeled.jpg"/>

       <br/>
        <li>
          <b>Pistils (female)</b>. The entire <i>female</i> parts of the plant’s flower are the <b>pistils,</b> usually
          found in the center of the flower (as in the picture above). Pistils include three parts: a stigma, style,
          and an ovary. The <b>stigma</b> is the sticky tip of the pistil. The <b>style</b> is a slender stalk that
          connects the stigma to a hollow structure at the base of the flower called the <b>ovary;</b> this is the area
          that holds the <b>ovule</b>. Within the ovule are one or more (very tiny) <b>egg cells.</b>
        </li>

      </ul>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">
      <p>
        <b>Angiosperm reproduction:</b> The process of reproduction of angiosperm plants begins with <b>pollination</b>.
        Pollination happens when pollen is moved from the anther (a male organ of the flower) to the stigma (a female
        organ of the flower). The stigma can be on either the same or a different flower that the pollen came from.
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown below, when a pollen grain reaches the stigma, it “tunnels” down the style to the ovary and then to the
        ovule.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align:left">
        <img alt="pollen_diagram" height="400" src="pollengrain.png" style="float:left;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px" width="275"/>
      </div>
      <br/>

      <p>
        <b>Fertilization.</b> When the sperm cells from the pollen meet the egg cell in the ovule, the egg is
        fertilized. It now has all the DNA it needs to become a new plant.
        The newly fertilized egg is called a zygote. The zygote eventually develops into a young plant.

      </p>
   
<br>
      <p style="clear: left; text-align: left;">
        <b>Developing plant.</b> The picture below shows a cross-sectional view of an ovary (light green) with an ovule
        inside the ovary (shown as darker green). This is shown at two points in time. At Time 1, the egg cell within
        the ovule has just been
        fertilized by pollen. The fertilized egg cell (zygote) is magnified in this picture so you can see it. (Since it's only
        a single cell, in reality, you'd need a microscope to see it.)
      </p>

      <img alt="plant_cell_diagram" class="img-centered img-size" src="SimplifiedCombinedplantcells_2-11_brown4.jpg"/>

      <p>
        Time 2 (shown above, right) is a later time, after
        the zygote has developed into a little plant embryo. At this time, the ovule wall
        (yellow-orange in the picture above) has hardened to become a seed coat. This helps to protect the
        developing plant.
        As the zygote develops into a plant embryo, the ovary also grows and — in some species — becomes what we call "fruit" which we eat. 
      </p>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page3">

      <p>
        <b>Examples of fruits &amp; seeds.</b> In many angiosperms, there are actually several ovules within the ovary.
        Each ovule forms into a seed. The
        ovary grows and becomes what we call the "fruit" and eat.
        Because of their hard shells, we generally remove the seeds within the ovary/fruit we eat. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some more examples of fruits that developed from angiosperm ovaries:

      <h4>Reproduction in Sunflowers</h4>

      <p>
        <b><i>Parts of Sunflower flowers.</i></b> In sunflowers (shown in the picture below), the <i>disk florets</i> 
        are the darker parts in the middle of the flowers. (The disk florets form the shape of a disc, like a
        bagel or doughnut.) This is where sunflower seeds are produced. The disk florets are surrounded by bright
        yellow "ray florets", which look like petals. But each ray floret (or "petal") is actually a flower. But the
        petal-like ray florets are sterile, mearning they cannot produce seeds.
      </p>

      <div>
        <img alt="sunflowers" src="sunflower-3526901_1920.jpg" style="float:left" width="400"/>

        <p>
          Each disk floret (the darker yellow or orange parts that together form a donut shape) is a flower. So, what
          we call a sunflower is actually a whole bunch of little flowers! (Kind of crazy, right?)
        </p>


      </div>
<br><br>
      <div p style="clear: left; text-align: left;">
        Each disk floret has both male parts and female parts. The male parts of each floret include anthers, which have
        pollen grains that stick to it. You can see the anthers of the disk florets in the picture below. The female
        parts of each floret are the stigma, the style, and the ovary. Pollination happens when pollen from the anthers
        (somehow) gets on
        the surfaces of the stigma.
      </p></div>

     <br/>
      <img alt="disk_floret_diagram" class="img-centered" src="DiskFloret.png"/>
     <br/>

      <p>
        One way that pollen gets from anthers to the stigma is when it sticks to insects like bees. Bees might pick up
        pollen on the hairs of their bodies when they walk on the flowers or even when they just fly by the flowers
        (see the unit:
        <a class="brm-link" href="../angiosperm-pollination/" target="_blank">Angiosperm Pollinators (Bees)</a>
        for how this happens!). Bees and other insects can then transfer the pollen they have picked up to the stigma
        and other parts of the same or a different flower when they walk around feeding on the sunflowers.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="page" id="page5">
      <p>
        <b>Fertilization of sunflowers.</b> When pollen gets on the stigma, it starts tunneling
        down the stigma until it gets to the ovule. The <b>sperm cells</b> from the pollen and <b>egg cell</b> in the
        ovule join together in the flower’s ovary to form a <b>zygote</b> (a fertilized egg cell). This eventually
        forms a sunflower seed.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img alt="disk_floret_diagram" class="img-centered" src="DiskFloret.png"/>
     <br/>

      <p>
        <b>Sunflower seeds.</b> The seeds of the sunflower plant, which is also an angiosperm, are a bit different from
        other types of seeds. After fertilization, instead of the ovule hardening, the ovary hardens.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, what people tend to think of as a sunflower "seed" (the black and white covering, shown
        below, to the left) is actually the "fruit" of the sunflower from the ovary (even though you wouldn't want to
        eat it!). The seed of the sunflower (shown below, right) is actually inside the hard fruit exterior. The seed
        developed from the sunflower's fertilized ovule. This is what people eat as snacks.
