    <h1>Kinetic Energy and Temperature</h1>

    <div id="page1" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>What is Kinetic Energy?</b> All moving objects (including atoms and molecules) have a form of energy called
        kinetic energy. This is the energy that objects have that is due to their movement. Because there are different
        types of motion, there are different kinds of kinetic energy. 
      </p>
Types of kinetic energy include:<br>
<ul>
        <li>(a) translational kinetic energy </li><br>
        <li>(b) rotational kinetic energy </li><br>
        <li>(c) vibrational kinetic energy </li><br>
</ul>

      <p>
        In this section, we will talk about the <i><u>translational</u></i> kinetic energy of an object. This is
        the kinetic energy of objects due to their movement across a distance (shown below). 
      </p>
<br>
<img class="img-centered" src="car_speeding.png"
<br><br>
      <p>
        Translational kinetic energy is typically the type of kinetic energy people mean when they talk about
        "kinetic energy." The translational kinetic energy of an object's atoms/molecules is also the type of kinetic
        energy that defines the object's <b>temperature</b>. In this section, we will be talking about translational
        kinetic energy, but we will just call it "kinetic energy" here.
      </p>

<div id="page2" class="page">

      <p>
        The relationship between the kinetic energy of an object and its mass (<b>m</b>) and speed (or
        velocity, <b>v</b>) is shown below:
      </p>

             alt="The relationship between the kinetic energy of an object and its mass (m) and speed (or velocity)" />
      </a>
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>
          For objects moving at the same speed, more massive objects have greater kinetic energy than less
          massive objects. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For objects of the same mass, faster-moving objects have greater kinetic energy than slower-moving objects.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <b>Definition of temperature.</b> The <b>temperature </b>of an object is the average kinetic energy of the
        particles (atoms and/or molecules) that make up the object. The kinetic energy of individual particles is
        determined by both their <b><i>speed</i></b> and <b><i>mass</i></b>. So, the temperature of an object increases
        as the speed or mass of its atoms/molecules increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say there are two containers of the same gas (e.g., helium atoms). As shown in the picture below (a
        microscopic view showing just a few of the millions of atoms in the containers), the helium atoms in Container
        1 (below, left) are moving at about twice the average speed of the helium atoms in Container 2 (below, right).
        The length of the arrows represents the speed of the atoms: longer arrows mean higher speed. The direction of
        the arrows shows the direction of motion at that time point.

          Because its atoms are moving faster, we know that the temperature of the helium in Container 1 is higher

        Now let's say we have a container with helium atoms and a second container with argon atoms. (Again, a
        microscopic view of only a few of the millions of atoms in each container are shown below.) The helium atoms

          which includes the "atomic mass" for each element). So, the average kinetic energy of the argon atoms in
          Container 3 is greater than the average kinetic energy of the helium atoms in Container 1. In other words,
          the gas in Container 3 has a higher temperature than the gas in Container 1.
