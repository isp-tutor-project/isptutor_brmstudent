        <img style='text-align:center'>Did you know that because there is so much algae on Earth, algae are responsible for most of the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere? 
        So, algae are very important plants for the Earth’s environment and its animals (including people). 
        That's why algae are so important for us to study.
        
        <br><br>Algae are defined as simple plants that do not have flowers. 
        There are types of algae that have many cells (such as seaweeds) 
        and other types of algae that are only made of one single cell (like "diatoms"). 
        
        Algae contain chlorophyll and make their own food using light in the process of

        </font></span></p><p><font size='3' color='#222222'>Algae lack true stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissue. 
          So, algae are non-vascular plants, which means they don't have tubes to transport water throughout the plant.</font>

          The picture above is an example of a multi-cellular (many-celled) form of algae called brown algae. 
          Even though it looks like many vascular plants, it doesn't have tubes that transport water throughout the plant. Brown algae 
          doesn't have roots that absorb water and nutrients (and transport them throughout the plant) either. Instead, the root-like 
          structures of brown algae hold the plant in place. These are called "holdfasts" (makes sense, right?).
          <br><br>Another important part of brown algae are the "gas bladders." Though they might look kind of like flowers (or fruits), they are not flowers.
          The gas bladders are pods that contain (you guessed it!) gases (air). Gas bladders help keep the algae from sinking to the bottom of the ocean, where they would die due to lack of sunlight.

            single-celled algae don't have all of these parts: stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissues. (All of these parts are made of lots

          <font size='3' color='#222222'><b>Types of Algae </b></font><p><font size='3'><font color='#222222'>Algae are extremely diverse: there are at least 30,000 different species of algae. The different species of algae respond differently to factors like light intensity/brightness, temperature, and the amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) dissolved in the water surrounding the algae. 
            <br><br>

            Two major categories of algae are <b>microscopic uni-cellular (single-celled) algae</b> and <b>larger multi-cellular 
              (many-celled) algae</b>. Let's take a closer look at each category.

            <br><br><br>
            <b>Microscopic unicellular algae.</b> Diatoms are one </font><b><font color='#0000ff'><a target='_blank' href='../taxonomy/index.html'><font color='#0000ff'>Class</font></a> </font></b><font color='#222222'>of uni-cellular (single-celled) algae.

              One species of diatoms is Chaetoceros muelleri. 
              
              <br><br>As shown in the picture below, diatoms have transparent cell walls that you can see through. 
              Diatoms are found on surfaces of both fresh water (like lakes) and salt water (oceans). Like all algae, diatoms use photosynthesis to make their food. </span></p><font size='3' color='#222222'>
                              
              When diatoms die, their remains sink to the bottom of the water and form a layer. 
              Shells of diatoms are a little bit rough. Because of this, people use the diatom shells to make toothpaste and other cleaning 
              products. </font></p><p></p><div style='display:block;text-align:center'><img width='299'

              <div><b>Multi-cellular algae.</b> Brown algae is one type of multi-cellular algae that includes over 1,000 species. One type of brown algae is what 
                some people may think of as seaweed. Despite its name, brown algae contains pigments (called fucoxanthin) that reflect 
                yellow light; as a result, brown algae appears yellow-ish (see the picture below). Energy from the (non-yellow) wavelengths 
                of light that these pigments absorb helps photosynthesis occur. <br><br>

                  Brown algae—like that shown in the picture above—lives and thrives in cool, rocky waters, like off North American coasts of the Atlantic Ocean. 
                  Giant kelp is another type of brown algae, which lives off the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Harvested brown algae is 
                  used to make pudding and salad dressing. </div>

        <b>Green algae</b> 
        (which includes the Phylum: Chlorophyta, which has about 4,500 known species) are found on land around the bases of 
        trees in moist areas. They are also found in both fresh and salt water (near the surface). 
      </span></p><p><font size='3' color='#222222'>Green algae can be either uni-cellular or multi-cellular. 
        Seaweed is one example of multi-cellular green algae. Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana are two species of 
        uni-cellular green algae. 
        
        <br><br>

        The algae is green due to the chlorophyll pigments it contains (like most plants). 
        Green algae is also commonly found in swimming pools and fish tanks. The picture below shows a microscopic 
        image of one type of green algae:</font></p>

      <br><div><b>Red algae</b> is another type of algae. Most red algae is multi-cellular. There are over 7,000 species of Red Algae. Red algae tend to live in 
        deeper waters. The pigment found within red algae is able to absorb small amounts of light energy—mostly 
        the higher-energy blue light that is able to travel farther through water than lower-energy light. This higher-energy 
        blue light is used in photosynthesis. This type of algae appears red because it reflects (lower-energy) red light. 
        But some species of “red” algae actually appear other colors, including orange, yellow, and pink (just not blue, 
        because they absorb blue light).</div><div><br/></div><div>
        The seaweed shown below is one example of multi-cellular red algae. Products made from red algae range from food

          <b>Problems with algae overgrowth</b>  
          <br><br>
          <div>When there is an increase in the amount of 
            nutrients in the water (including CO<sub>2</sub>), algae can grow quickly. This can cause the water to turn in color to various shades such 
            as brown, red, green and even become colorless, depending on the species of algae in “bloom”. These tides can 
            become dangerous, because algae make toxins (poisons) when they are too densely packed together. 
            
            
            <br<br>The toxins released by algae collect 
            in the bodies of the organisms
              (for example, small fish) eating the algae, which 
                may kill them. If these organisms
                  do not die from eating the concentrated

                          Humans are more likely to cause blooms in lakes and other freshwater bodies. This happens when farmers and other people 
                          over-fertilize soil; the extra nutrients in fertilizers can dissolve in drainage water and seep 
                          into nearby bodies of water. 
                          The excessive buildup of nutrients in bodies of water in turn causes the over-growth of algae. 
                          This process is called eutrophication (from Greek, "eu" is "good," and, remember that "troph" 
                          means "nourishing"). 
            But in this case, the algae are getting <b>too much</b> nourishment and become a problem! 
          <br><br>Next, we'll talk about some other factors that affect the growth rate of different algae species: temperature, light, and carbon dioxide.
          </div></div>

          <div id="page4" class="page">

<b>Effects of temperature on algae growth.</b> 
 
The rate that algae reproduces depends on the temperature of the water it's in. But, since different species of algae grow at different rates,
we need to look at the relationship between temperature and algae growth rate for specific species of algae.

<br><br>The graph below shows the growth rate of two species of "Chlorella" algae, Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella NJ18, at different temperatures. 
As the temperature increases from 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees F), the growth rate increases up to 25-30 degree C. 
But when the temperature gets above 25-30 C (77-86 F), the growth rates actually start decreasing. 
In other words, when it's too hot, these algae don't grow as well. When it gets to 35 degrees C (95 F), these algae completely stop growing.
<br><br>


<center><img style='text-align:center' src='ChlorellaVulgaris_GrowthByTemp.png' height='400' img-align='center'></center>

<br><br>The graph below shows the growth rates of two other species of green algae: Chlorella sorokiniana and Picochlorum. As you can see from the y-axis on the graph, 
their growth rates are much higher than the growth rates of Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella NJ18. In fact, the maximum growth rate for Chlorella sorokiniana
is much higher than the three other species of green algae. <br>

<br><br>
<center><img style='text-align:center' src='AlgaeSorokianaTempGrowth.png' height='400' img-align='center'></center>

<br><br>

But what all 4 species of algae have in common is that they stop growing when it gets too hot (around 45 C or 113 F). 
This is because photosynthesis stops when it gets too hot.

                <b>Effects of light intensity on algae growth.</b> 

                The relationship between light intensity (how bright the light is) and the growth rate of another species of Chlorella algae, 
                Chlorella sorokiniana algae, is curved. At 36 C, the growth rate is highest at around
