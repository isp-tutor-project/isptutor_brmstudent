        <img style='text-align:center'>Algae are defined as simple nonflowering plants. 
        They are part of a large group that includes multi-cellular forms (such as seaweeds) and many single-celled forms. 
        Algae contain chlorophyll, so they are autotropic (from Greek, “auto” meaning “self”, and “troph” meaning “nourishing”). 
        This means they can make their own food through photosynthesis. This means they need light to make their own food and to grow. 
        See the </font><a target='_blank' href='../photosynthesis/index.html'><b><font color='#0000ff'>Photosynthesis</font>

        </font></span></p><p><font size='3' color='#222222'>However, algae lack true stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissue. 
          Thus, algae are classified as non-vascular plants 
        (lacking in tubes to transport water throughout the plant).</font></p>

          The picture above is an example of a multi-cellular form of algae (brown algae). Even though it resembles many vascular plants, it does not have tubes to transport water throughout the plant or roots that absorb water and nutrients (and transport them throughout the plant). The function of the root-like structure is to hold the plant in place. (Appropriately, the root-like structures are called "holdfasts.") <p><span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>As you can probably easily imagine, single-celled algae also lack stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissues.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><b style='background-color:transparent;font-size:medium;color:rgb(34,34,34)'>How big are algae?</b></p><p><font size='3' color='#222222'>

      <div><b>Red algae</b> is another type of algae. There are over 7,000 species of Red Algae. Red algae tend to live in deeper waters. The pigment found within red algae is able to collect or absorb small amounts of light energy—primarily the higher-energy blue light that is able to travel farther through water than lower-energy light—and use this light in photosynthesis. This type of algae appears red because it reflects (lower-energy) red light. However, some species of “red” algae actually appear other colors, such as orange, yellow, or pink (but not blue).</div><div><br/></div><div>
        Examples of red algae are multi-cellular seaweed (as shown below). Products from this material are used for products ranging from food including products to make iced cream to hair conditioners.</div></div><div><br/></div><div>

One type of brown algae is what some people may think of as seaweed. Despite its name, brown algae contains pigments (called fucoxanthin) that reflect yellow light; as a result, brown algae appears yellow-ish (see the picture below). Energy from the (non-yellow) wavelengths of light that these (fucoxanthin) pigments absorb helps photosynthesis occur.</div><div><br/></div><div><div style='display:block;text-align:left'><img width='400' style='display:inline;align='center' src='https://sites.google.com/site/isptutorbrmstudent/_/rsrc/1560954660800/algae/seaweed-1614647_1920.jpg' height='265' border='0' align='center'/></div><br/></div><div><div>Brown algae—like that shown in the picture above—lives and thrive in cool, rocky waters, like off of the Atlantic coast of North America. Giant kelp—one type of brown algae—lives off the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Harvested brown algae is used in the production of pudding and salad dressing. </div><div>
          <br><br>
          <b>Problems with algae over growth</b>  </div><div><br/></div><div>When there is an increase in the amount of nutrients in the water, algae may grow quickly. This can cause the water to turn in color to various shades such as brown, red, green and even become colorless, depending on the species of algae in “bloom”. These tides can become dangerous, because they are toxic or poisonous when algae reaches a high concentration. The toxins collect in the bodies of the organisms (<span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>for example</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>, small fish) consuming or eating the algae, which may kill them. If these organisms (</span><span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>for example</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>, smaller fish) do not die from eating the concentrated algae, predators (</span><span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>for example</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>, larger fish) who eat them may become ill. </span></div><div><br/></div><div>Blooms can be found in both salt water and fresh water. Blooms in salt water are far more difficult to control because they have vast boundaries. However, humans are more likely to cause blooms in fresh water (than salt water) bodies.</div><div><br/></div><div>The increase in nutrient concentration in fresh water bodies may be caused by the run-off of water from nearby land that has been fertilized. That is, when we over-fertilize our soil, the extra chemicals can dissolve in drainage water and seep into nearby bodies of water. The excessive buildup of nutrients in bodies of water in turn causes the over growth of algae. (This process is called eutrophication (from Greek, "eu" is  "good," and, remember that "troph" means "nourishing." But in this case, the algae are getting <b>too much</b> nourishment!) </div></div><div><br/></div></div>
