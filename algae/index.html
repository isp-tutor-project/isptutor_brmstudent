        <img style='text-align:center'>Algae are defined as simple plants that do not have flowers. 
        There are types of algae that have many cells (such as seaweeds) 
        and other types of algae that are only made of one single cell (like "diatoms"). 
        
        Algae contain chlorophyll, so they are autotropic (from Greek, “auto” meaning “self”, and “troph” meaning “nourishing”). 
        This means they make their own food using light in the process of

        </font></span></p><p><font size='3' color='#222222'>Algae lack true stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissue. 
          So, algae are non-vascular plants, which means they don't have tubes to transport water throughout the plant.</font>

          The picture above is an example of a multi-cellular (many-celled) form of algae, brown algae. 
          Even though it looks like many vascular plants, it doesn't have tubes to transport water throughout the plant or 
          roots that absorb water and nutrients (and transport them throughout the plant). The function of the root-like 
          structure--called "holdfasts" (makes sense, right?)--is to hold the plant in place. 
          Another important part of brown algae are the "gas bladders." Though they might look kind of like flowers (or fruits), they are not flowers.
          The gas bladders contain (you guessed it!) gases, which help keep the algae from sinking to the bottom of the ocean, where they would die due to lack of sunlight.

            single-celled algae don't have all of these parts: stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissues. (All of these parts are made of lots

        deeper waters. The pigment found within red algae is able to collect or absorb small amounts of light energy—mostly 
        the higher-energy blue light that is able to travel farther through water than lower-energy light. This higher-energy 
        blue light is used in photosynthesis. This type of algae appears red because it reflects (lower-energy) red light. 
        But some species of “red” algae actually appear other colors, including orange, yellow, and pink (but not blue).</div><div><br/></div><div>

          <b>Problems with algae overgrowth</b>  
          <br><br>
          <div>When there is an increase in the amount of 
            nutrients in the water (including CO<sub>2</sub>), algae may grow quickly. This can cause the water to turn in color to various shades such 
            as brown, red, green and even become colorless, depending on the species of algae in “bloom”. These tides can 
            become dangerous, because they are toxic or poisonous when algae reaches a high concentration. The toxins collect 
            in the bodies of the organisms (<span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>
              for example, small fish) consuming or eating the algae, which 
                may kill them. If these organisms (</span><span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>
                  for example</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>, smaller fish) do not die from eating the concentrated 
                    algae, predators (</span><span style='color:rgb(34,34,34);font-size:medium;background-color:transparent'>for 
                      example</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>, larger fish) who eat them may become ill. 
                      </span></div><div><br/></div><div>Blooms can be found in both salt water and fresh water. Blooms in salt water are 
                        far more difficult to control because they have vast boundaries. However, humans are more likely to cause blooms 
                        in fresh water (than salt water) bodies.</div><div><br/></div><div>The increase in nutrient concentration in fresh 
                          water bodies may be caused by the run-off of water from nearby land that has been fertilized. That is, when we 
                          over-fertilize our soil, the extra chemicals can dissolve in drainage water and seep into nearby bodies of water. 
                          The excessive buildup of nutrients in bodies of water in turn causes the over growth of algae. (This process is 
                          called eutrophication (from Greek, "eu" is  "good," and, remember that "troph" means "nourishing." 
            But in this case, the algae are getting <b>too much</b> nourishment!) 
          <br><br>On the next few pages, we'll talk about factors that affect the growth rate of different algae species.

<b>Effect of light intensity on algae growth.</b> 

The graph below shows the growth rate of the species "Chlorella sorokiniana" algae, at different temperatures. 
As the temperature increases from 14 degrees celsius to 36 degrees celsius, the growth rate increases. This is true for all light intensities.
