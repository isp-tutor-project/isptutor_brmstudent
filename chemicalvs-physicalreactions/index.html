        <b>Types of processes (or reactions).</b> In your everyday life, you have seen many different kinds of natural
        processes. You've probably watched water boil, observed substances spread throughout water, like when you add
        food coloring to water or make Kool Aid or tea. Or you may have been impressed with "explosions" that result
        from combining different chemicals, such as combining mentos mints and soda/pop or vinegar and baking soda.
      </p>
      <br>

      <img class="img-centered" src="chemphysexamples_cropped.jpg" alt="egg_boiling_in_water_hottea_egg_cooking" width="800"/>

      <br>
      <p>
        We can categorize these processes as either chemical processes or physical processes. The difference
        between chemical and physical processes is whether new substances are formed during the reaction process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        **The key difference between physical and chemical processes: In chemical processes, new substances are
        formed. But in physical processes, the substances remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>

<div id="page2" class="page">

        <b>What are chemical vs. physical processes?</b> In chemical processes,
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../molecules/">molecules</a> 
        break apart into atoms. The atoms re-combine with other atoms to form different molecules. But in
        physical processes, the molecules do not change. For example, a molecule of water is H<sub>2</sub>O.
        It has two Hydrogen atoms and one Oxygen atom. In the physical processes of freezing or boiling, the
        water molecules remain H<sub>2</sub>O. The Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms stay together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signs of a possible chemical reaction include a change in color after the reaction. With a physical
        reaction, you may see a change in shape (such as when water freezes from a liquid into solid ice).
        But these signs are just general "rules of thumb" and there are exceptions.

        <b>Chemical processes or chemical reactions.</b> In a chemical process, the original substances react with
        each other to form new substances. The new substances are made of different types of 
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../molecules/">molecules</a>
        from the original substances. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">Let's look at two examples
        of chemical reactions:
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="gas-flame-1452999_1920.jpg" alt="water_boiling_on_gas_stove" />

      <p>
        <b>Example #1:</b> When someone cooks on a gas stove, methane gas and oxygen react with each other to
        make the flame we see on the stove. (This is shown in the picture above.) Methane and oxygen react to
        produce two different types of molecules: carbon dioxide and water. This reaction is shown below:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Methane molecule + 2 Oxygen molecules &#8594; Carbon Dioxide + Water</li>
      </ul>
      Or,
      <ul>
        <li>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> (Reactants) &#8594; CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (Products)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In this reaction, each CH<sub>4</sub> (methane) molecule breaks apart into one C (carbon) and four H
        (hydrogen) atoms. The C atoms join with two O (oxygen) atoms to form a new molecule, CO<sub>2</sub>
        (carbon dioxide). Also during the reaction, the hydrogen atoms join the other two oxygen atoms,
        forming water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
      </p>
      <p style="color:#0000ff">
        Since the products of the reaction (carbon dioxide and water) are <u>different</u> from the reactants
        (methane and oxygen), this is a chemical reaction.

      <p>
        <b>Example #2.</b> If you mix hydrochloric acid (HCl), which of course is an acid, and sodium hydroxide
        (NaOH), which is a base, they react with each other and produce two different substances. These new
        substances are sodium chloride (NaCl), which is common table salt, and water (H<sub>2</sub>O).

      <p>
        This reaction is shown below:

      <p>
        <li>HCl + NaOH (Reactants) &#8594; NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O (Products)</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        During this reaction, the NaOH molecules break apart into Na, O, and H. The HCl molecules break
        apart into H and Cl atoms. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Na and Cl atoms join to form NaCl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the H atom joins the O and H to form H<sub>2</sub>O.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#0000ff">
        The products of the reaction, NaCl (common table salt) and water, are
        different molecules than HCl and NaOH. So, this is another chemical reaction.

        <b>How can you tell if a reaction is physical or chemical?</b> It may be hard to tell for sure if a reaction
        is a chemical or physical reaction. But here are some general "rules of thumb" that let you know that a 
        <b>chemical reaction</b> may have occurred:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The products have <u>different tastes</u> than any of the reactants.
        </li>
        <li>
          The products have <u>different boiling or freezing points</u> than any of the reactants.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a <u>temperature change</u> <i>caused by the reactants alone</i> (not by other heat sources,
          like heating the chemicals on a stove). So, if you use the stove/microwave or refrigerator/freezer
          (something else) to raise or lower the temperature, that is NOT a sign that a chemical change has happened.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The products of the reaction are <u>different colors</u> than any of the initial reactants. (Not just
            lighter or darker shades of the original color.)
          </p>

          <img class="img-centered" src="ink-2427263_1920 (1).jpg" width="500px" alt="ink_in_water">

          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              One exception to color changes indicating that a chemical process has occurred is when colors are
              mixed together to form a different color. For example, if you put a drop of blue dye into a glass
              of water and put a drop of yellow dye into the water, the water will appear to turn green. But this
              is NOT a chemical reaction. The molecules of blue dye have not changed, and the molecules of yellow
              dye do not change. The apparent color change results from how our brains process the mixture of
              colors (see the unit:

            </li>
            <li>
              There are also cases of chemical changes in which the products are <u>not</u> different colors
              from reactants. For example, in a vinegar and baking soda reaction, a chemical change occurs that
              produces carbon dioxide, water, and sodium acetate. But there is no color change (like baking soda,
              sodium acetate also happens to be white in color).

        <b>Physical processes.</b> Unlike chemical processes, the atoms or molecules that make up the original

        So, state changes are <b>physical processes</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture below shows water (H<sub>2</sub>O) in its solid, liquid, and gas states. In each state, the water
        molecule remains H<sub>2</sub>O. That is, ice is made of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, liquid water is made of
        H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, and water vapor is made of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        H<sub>2</sub>O molecules do not change when liquid water freezes into ice or evaporates into water vapor.
        H<sub>2</sub>O molecules do not change when ice melts into water or when water vapor condenses to liquid or
        solid. So, freezing, evaporating, melting, and condensing are all <b>physical processes</b>. In general,
        when <u>any</u> substance (not just water) changes state, this is a physical process.

        <b><u>Conservation of matter</u> in chemical and physical processes.</b> In both
        chemical and physical reactions, the total <i>number</i> of
        atoms that existed before the reaction is the same as the total number of atoms
        after the reaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in both chemical and physical reaction, the total number of each type of atom (or each element) is the
        same before and after the reaction. So, for example, if there were 5 Hydrogen (H) atoms before a chemical
        or physical reaction occurs, there must be 5 H atoms after the reaction. If there were 100 atoms of Carbon
        before the reaction, there must be 100 atoms of Carbon after the reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can say that matter is "conserved" during all physical and chemical processes. This means that no new
        matter is made or destroyed during physical or chemical processes. This is the
        <b><u>principle of conservation of matter.</u></b>

          You're right! At first, the drop was made of 3 sextillion H2O molecules. One sextillion H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules remain in the drop. Due to
          conservation of matter, the total number of molecules that evaporated is 3 - 1 sextillion, or 2 sextillion. Simple math (and conservation of matter)!
