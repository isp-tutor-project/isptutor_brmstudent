            <h1>Coulomb's Law</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        <b>Coulomb's Law.</b> The strength of the electric force between two charged particles is related to two
        variables: (a) the distance between them, and (b) how much charge they have. We'll talk about how the strength
        of the electric force (F<sub>e</sub>) changes with distance first.
      </p>

      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b><i>Distance.</i></b> There is a strong relationship between the strength of Fe and distance between the
        charged particles. The relationship between the strength of the attractive or repulsive force between
        charged particles (F<sub>e</sub>) and distance between the particles (r) is shown below:
      </p>

      <img alt="Graph_showing_relationship_between_strength_of_Fe_and_distance_between_the_charged_particles" class="img-centered" src="OneOverRsquaredRel.PNG" width="400px"/>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The equation above shows that if the distance between the charged particles is very very large (let's say one
        million meters), the force between them would be very small. But when the particles are very close to each
        other, the force between them gets pretty big.
      </p>

     <br/>
      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b><i>The "net" charge of the particles.</i></b> As you might expect, the strength of the attractive or
        repulsive force between the charged particles is also proportional to the <i>net</i> charge of each of the
        particles (represented as "q").
      </p>
      <p>
        The net charge of a particle is the difference between the number of electrons and protons the particle
        has (since positive and negative charges "cancel each other out"):
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Net charge of a particle (<b>q<sub>net</sub></b>) = Number of protons that particle has - Number of electrons
          particle has.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So, if we have two charged particles, the electric force is proportional to the net charge of each particle:
      </p>

      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b>
        <span class="font-roboto text-lg">∝</span>
        <b>q<sub>net<sub>1</sub></sub></b>
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b>
        <span class="font-roboto text-lg">∝</span>
        <b>q<sub>net<sub>2</sub></sub></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can combine these relationships into one equation, called Coulomb's Law.
      </p>

     <br/>
      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b>Coulomb's Law.</b> OK, so we know that the strength of the electric force between charged particles
        increases as the particles get closer to each other. We also know that the strength of the electic force
        increases as the total charges of the two particles increases. The exact strength of the electric force between
        two charged particles can be calculated by using Coulomb's Law (below):
      </p>

      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b> = <b>k<sub>e </sub></b>
        <span class="text-xs">×</span>
        <b><u>q<sub>net<sub>1</sub></sub>q<sub>net<sub>2</sub></sub></u></b>
       <br/>
        <b>               r<sup>2</sup></b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Where <b>k<sub>e</sub></b> is "Coulomb's constant," which is about
          9 × 10<sup>9</sup> Newtons × meters<sup>2</sup>/Coulombs<sup>2</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>q<sub>1</sub></b> is the charge (in Coulombs) of Particle 1
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>q<sub>2</sub></b> is the charge (in Coulombs) of Particle 2
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>r</b> is the distance between the two charged particles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Note: The charge of one proton is equal to 1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that the force between two charged particles increases as the total amount of charge increases. So,
        say you rubbed a balloon on your head, which transferred 50 electrons to the balloon. But your sister rubbed
        another balloon on her head, which transferred 100 electrons. Your sister's hair would be pulled by the balloon
        with four times the force your hair would be pulled with (and more of her hair would likely stick to the
        balloon).
      </p>
      <p>
        This force also increases as the distance between the charged particles <i>de</i>creases.
