      <p>
        <b>Coulomb's Law.</b> The strength of the electric force between two charged particles is related to two
        variables: (a) the distance between them (r), and (b) the "net" charges of the particles. We'll talk about how the strength
        of the electric force (F<sub>e</sub>) changes with distance first.
      </p>

      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b><i>Distance.</i></b> There is a strong relationship between the strength of the electric force, Fe, and distance between the
        charged particles. The relationship between the strength of the attractive or repulsive force between
        charged particles (F<sub>e</sub>) and distance between the particles (r) is shown below:
      </p>

      

      <img alt="Graph_showing_relationship_between_strength_of_Fe_and_distance_between_the_charged_particles" class="img-centered" src="OneOverRsquaredRel.PNG" width="400px"/>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The equation above shows that if the distance between the charged particles is very very large (let's say one
        million meters), the force between them would be very small. But when the particles are very close to each
        other, the force between them gets pretty big.
      </p>

     <br/>
      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b><i>The "net" charge of the particles.</i></b> As you might expect, the strength of the attractive or
        repulsive force between the charged particles is also proportional to the <i>net</i> charge of each of the
        particles (represented as "q").
      </p>
      <p>
        The net charge of a particle is the difference between the number of electrons and protons the particle
        has (since positive and negative charges "cancel each other out"):
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Net charge of a particle (<b>q(net)</b>) = Number of protons that particle has - Number of electrons
          the particle has. So, for example, a particle with 100 electrons and 100 protons would have a net charge of 
          <select class="fib_select" id="FIB1" onchange="fibUpdate('FIB1')">
          <option value="#ffffff">(Select one)</option>
          <option value="#11bf7a">zero</option>
          <option value="#ed8587">+100</option>
          <option value="#ed8587">-100</option>
          <option value="#ed8587">(not enough information is given)</option>
        </select>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So, if we have two charged particles, the electric force is proportional to the net charge of each particle:
      </p>

      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b>
        <span class="font-roboto text-lg">∝</span>
        <b>q(net)1</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b>
        <span class="font-roboto text-lg">∝</span>
        <b>q(net)2</b>
      </p>
      <img alt="Particles_distance_between" class="img-centered" src="Particles_NetCharge.png" width="450px"/>
      
      <p>
In the figure above, Particle 1 is made of 2 protons and one electron (for a net charge of +1). Particle 2 is made of 2 electrons and one proton (for a net charge of -1). 
The net charges of +1 and -1 are +/-1 times the charge of one proton/electron.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        We can combine the relationships between Fe and r and Fe and q(net) into one equation, called Coulomb's Law...
      </p>

    
      <hr/>

      <p>
        <b>Coulomb's Law.</b> We know that the strength of the electric force between charged particles
        increases as (1) the particles get closer to each other and (2) as the total charges of the two particles increases. 
        The exact strength of the electric force between
        two charged particles can be calculated by using Coulomb's Law (below):
      </p>

      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>F<sub>e</sub></b> = <b>k<sub>e </sub></b>
        <span class="text-xs">×</span>
        <b><u>q(net)1*q(net)2</u></b>
       <br/>
        <b>               r<sup>2</sup></b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Where <b>k<sub>e</sub></b> is "Coulomb's constant," which is about
          9 × 10<sup>9</sup> Newtons × meters<sup>2</sup>/Coulombs<sup>2</sup>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>q(net)1</b> is the net charge (in Coulombs) of Particle 1
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>q(net)2</b> is the net charge (in Coulombs) of Particle 2
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>r</b> is the distance between the two charged particles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      

      <p>
        (Note: The charges of protons and electrons are given in the unit called "Coulombs." 
        One proton is equal to +1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs. An electron has the same sized charge as a proton, but is negatively charged 
        (-1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> Coulombs). To simplify in the example 
        below, we'll call the charges of one proton or electron "one charge unit.")

        <b>Applied example:</b> 
        Say you rubbed an initially uncharged balloon on your hair, which was also initially uncharged. This transferred 50 electrons from your hair to the balloon. 
        Your look-alike twin rubs another (initially uncharged) balloon on their hair, which transferred 100 electrons from the balloon to their hair. Your twin's hair would be pulled by the 
        balloon with <b>four</b> times the force your hair would be pulled with. 
      </p>

<p id="demo" style="display: none">

This is because after rubbing the balloon, you hair has a net charge of +50 charge units. Your balloon now has a net 
      charge of -50 charge units. So, the product of the net charge is 50*50 = 2,500 charge units. 
      <br><br>
      After rubbing the balloon on their hair, your twin's 
      hair has a net charge of +100 charge units, and their balloon has a net charge of -100 charge units. So, the product of the net charge is 
      100*100 = 10,000 charge units. 
      <br><br>
      10,000 is four times 2,500, when the balloon and hair are the same distances from each other for you and you twin.
      <br><br>
        This force also increases as the distance between the charged particles &mdash; in this case the balloon and hair &mdash; 
        <i>de</i>creases.
