          <b>About this website (for teachers).</b> This website is part of the <a class="brm-link" target="_blank"
            href="https://www.isptutor.org/">ISP (Inquiry-based Science Project) Tutor</a>, for middle school students.
          It was developed under a research grant from the Department of Education to Prof. David Klahr (PI) and Dr.
          Stephanie Siler (Co-PI) and a team
          of middle school teachers and education researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.
          The content of this website is based on Next Generation Science Standards and designed to support students'
          background research for common science fair project research questions (e.g., the research question shown
          above).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          <b>Below is a lesson on doing background research for a chosen research question.</b> This lesson may be split into individual lessons
          on selecting good research questions (Steps 1 &amp; 2), planning research (Steps 2 - 4), or given in its entirety (Steps 1 - 6).
          Students can download an editable booklet that gives directions and asks
          questions throughout the lesson. Students then view a video of a virtual student deciding on a research topic
          by considering what they already know (Step 1). Next, students work through
          a lesson in which they select a research topic and question (Step 2).
          Then, students can view a brief lesson where a virtual student explains how they plan for their background
          research (Step 3). In Step 4, students plan their own research.
          Afterward, in Step 5, students watch a video in which a virtual student conducts background research and
          synthesizes information to form a hypothesis for their research question (research has shown students have
          difficulty with this).
          Finally, students use this website to do background research for their research question and ultimately
          develop a hypothesis for their research question (Step 6).

              science area of your research question (e.g., "Forces &amp; Motion").
              You'll see a list of units relevant to the topic you chose.

             <br/><br/>
              Or, you can type what you would like to find out about in the <u>search bar</u> above (as shown below).
              Click
              on the little magnifying glass and you'll see a list of units that include those key words (you may see
              some
              Ads in the list of results: just ignore those). Just click
              on the link of a unit you'd like to look at.
