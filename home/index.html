          <b>About this website (for teachers).</b> This website is part of the <a class="brm-link" href="https://www.isptutor.org/" target="_blank">ISP (Inquiry-based Science Project) Tutor</a>, for middle school students.
          It was developed under a research grant from the Department of Education to Prof. David Klahr (PI) and Dr.
          Stephanie Siler (Co-PI) and a team
          of middle school teachers and education researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.
          The content of this website is based on Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and designed to support students'
          background research for common science fair project research questions (e.g., the research question shown
          above).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          You and your students can also use this website as a resource to find various science units at the
            middle school level (and some more advanced topics at the high school level). Consistent with NGSS, these units were written to emphasize causality among science concepts and variables. 
            Cross-cutting concepts (as defined in NGSS) are emphasized across units in different domains to help students 
            develop generalized, robust understandings of these concepts.
            To find relevant units, you can type search terms into the search box above (scroll past any ads) or click on one of the four 
            science area topics above.<br><br>

          <b>Below is a lesson on doing background research for a chosen research question.</b> This lesson may be split into individual lessons
          on selecting good research questions (Steps 1 &amp; 2), planning research (Steps 2 - 4), or given in its entirety (Steps 1 - 6).
          Students can download an editable booklet that gives directions and asks
          questions throughout the lesson. Students then view a video of a virtual student deciding on a research topic
          by considering what they already know (Step 1). Next, students work through
          a lesson in which they select a research topic and question (Step 2).
          Then, students can view a brief lesson where a virtual student explains how they plan for their background
          research (Step 3). In Step 4, students plan their own research.
          Afterward, in Step 5, students watch a video in which a virtual student conducts background research and
          synthesizes information to form a hypothesis for their research question (research has shown students have
          difficulty with this).
          Finally, students use this website to do background research for their research question and ultimately
          develop a hypothesis for their research question (Step 6).
