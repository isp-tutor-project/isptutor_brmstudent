            <h1>Carbonated Water and Sodas</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">
        <p>
          Carbonated water is simply water (H<sub>2</sub>O) that has carbon dioxide dissolved throughout. Types
          of carbonated water include sparkling water and seltzer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What is soda? </b>Sodas (which some people call "pop") are made from carbonated water,
          but also contain flavors and sweeteners (e.g., sugars; aspartame). One 2 liter bottle of soda
          includes about 10 grams of CO<sub>2</sub>. This (10 g) might not sound like a lot.
          But what is the volume of 10 g of CO<sub>2</sub>?
        </p>
        <p>
          To find out the volume of 10 g of CO<sub>2</sub>, we can use the formula for density:
        </p>

        <ul class="brm-list">
          <li>
            D = m / V (density is equal to mass divided by volume; see
            <a class="brm-link" href="../density/" target="_blank">Density</a> 
            for more on density)
          </li>
          <li>
            V = m / D
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At standard temperature (0°C) and standard pressure (1 atmosphere, which is air
          pressure at sea level), the density of CO<sub>2</sub> is 0.002 grams/mL. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So,
        </p>

        <ul class="brm-list">
          <li>V = (10 g)/(.002 g/mL) = 5,000 mL = 5 L</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
          This means that there are about <b>5 liters</b> of CO<sub>2</sub> (at standard temperature
          and pressure) squeezed into and trapped in a bottle of soda! (Sounds crazy, right!?) The
          volume of CO<sub>2</sub> decreases as it cools and is pressurized, though, which is why it's able to fit in a bottle.
        </p>

         <b>How to make carbonated water.</b> As you may know, if you fill a glass with pure water and set it on a table, the water does
          not get carbonated on its own.
          <span>
            This is because at temperatures around room temperature (about 22°C/71°F),
            CO<sub>2</sub> molecules that make up the air are moving around fast. Even though H<sub>2</sub>O molecules
            have positive and negative charges, CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are moving fast and have enough kinetic
            energy to not get "caught" by these electric charges. So, CO<sub>2</sub> molecules stay in the air.
            Even if a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule happens to break through the surface of the water, it will not stay
            in the water for long. It will go back into the atmosphere.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to carbonate water, it is necessary to reduce the motion of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules. In other words, it is necessary to reduce the temperatures of the gas and water. This will
          allow the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to hold CO<sub>2</sub> in the liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can even make carbonated water at home (if you have the right equipment, including
          a tank with high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> in it!):
        </p>

        <ul class="brm-list">
          <li>
            First, cool a bottle of water to just above freezing (0°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then, with the cap off of the bottle, squeeze the bottle a bit until the water rises
            to the top of the bottle (and there is little remaining air in the bottle). The bottle
            will be a bit "crumpled," with the sides of the bottle pushed in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put a cap on the bottle. Use a special cap that has a nozzle on it, so you can pump
            CO<sub>2</sub> from your tank into the bottle (and not let other air into the bottle).
          </li>
          <li>
            Pump CO<sub>2</sub> from the high-pressure tank into the bottle. Gently shake the bottle. This will
            help CO<sub>2</sub> mix with and dissolve in the water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the above step until the bottle is no longer crumpled. It is now pressurized
            carbonated water!  Enjoy!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are now trapped in the water. Because the water is cooler (and H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules are moving more slowly), the water is a bit more dense and the bonds between H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules are also a bit stronger. The CO<sub>2</sub> molecules themselves also have less
          kinetic energy, or energy due to motion. So, they are less able to break through the (stronger) bonds
          between H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and leave the liquid.
        </p>

        <img class="img-centered img-size_med" alt="water molecule close up" src="brm_watercloseup.jpg"/>
        <br/>

        <p>
          As shown in the picture above, H<sub>2</sub>O molecules form spheres around CO<sub>2</sub>
          molecules (carbon atoms in the CO<sub>2</sub> are represented as larger and darker blue spheres and
          oxygen atoms as white spheres). This bonding of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to other H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules helps to hold the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the liquid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another reason that CO<sub>2</sub> remains dissolved in the water is that there is air at the top
          of the bottle. This is high-pressured CO<sub>2</sub>, where there are a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>
          molecules per volume. This high-pressure gas pushes down on the surface of the liquid.
          This pressure also helps prevent CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the liquid from leaving the liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you open a bottle of soda, you'll hear a "whooshing" sound. That's the sound of the
          high-pressure air leaving the bottle. You probably also noticed that some of the soda
          may bubble up (and out of the bottle, if you're not careful). This is from some of the
          CO<sub>2</sub> in the soda leaving the soda. Since there is now less air pressure at the surface
          of the soda, it's easier for the trapped CO<sub>2</sub> near the surface to escape from the soda.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you leave an open bottle of soda sitting around (with no cap on it), eventually it will
          lose all of its carbonation. (It also does not taste very good.) As the soda's temperature
          increases, the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules begin moving faster and the bonds between H<sub>2</sub>O
          molecules weaken. The CO<sub>2</sub> molecules also start moving around faster, enabling them
          to break through the H<sub>2</sub>O bonds. These factors allow CO<sub>2</sub> to eventually
          escape from the soda.

          <b>Soda "Explosion."</b>
            As we discussed at the beginning of this unit, a 2 liter bottle of soda has about 5 liters of CO<sub>2</sub> (at room temperature)
            trapped in it. This is 2.5 times its volume! When the water temperature is low, the water molecules help to hold
            the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the water by H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>O bonds. But when enough
            these bonds are broken, the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules can "break free" from within the water and
            cause the soda to "explode." This may happen when you shake a bottle of soda before opening it.
            The motion of shaking the soda may help break H<sub>2</sub>O-H<sub>2</sub>O bonds and allow the
            CO<sub>2</sub> molecules to escape from the water.
        </p>

        <ul class="brm-list">
          <li>
            CO<sub>2</sub> is less dense than water. Because of this, CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles will be pushed
            upward by buoyancy force (see
            <a class="brm-link" href="../buoyancy/index.html" target="_blank">Buoyancy force</a> 
            unit), causing it to escape from the water.
          </li>
          <li>
            The CO<sub>2</sub> in soda is also at a higher pressure than the air outside the bottle (it had
            to be forced into the bottle). This difference in pressure
            <span class="font-calibri text-sm">—</span>
            once enough CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are freely moving around in the soda
            <span class="font-calibri text-sm">—</span>
            will also push the CO<sub>2</sub>out of the bottle.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If enough CO<sub>2</sub> is able to escape (remember, there is a LOT of CO<sub>2</sub> in the water:
          around 5 liters!), it can push a lot of the liquid soda out of the bottle and cause a big "explosion"
          or "geyser."
        </p>

        <p>
          One cause of CO<sub>2</sub> exploding from a bottle of soda is "nucleation", where bubbles form on tiny
          bumps on surfaces (see
          <a class="brm-link" href="../nucleation/index.html" target="_blank">Nucleation unit</a>
          for more information).
