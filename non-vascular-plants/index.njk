        <b>Two Types of Plants.</b> Plants can be divided into Vascular and Non-Vascular Plants. This unit discusses
        <b>non-vascular plants</b>.

      <p>
        <b>Non-vascular plants</b> have very specific characteristics. The characteristics include lacking all of
        the following: (a) vascular tissue (cells that form tubes for transporting water and nutrients throughout
        the plant), (b) true leaves, (c) seeds, and (d) flowers. These plants do <u>not</u> have tubes to carry
        materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials including nutrients move slowly from one cell to another. Instead of roots, they have thin,
        hair-like structures (called rhizoids) that hold them to the ground. The rhizoids transfer water to the
        plants. For this reason, most of these plants are low to the ground and small, like mosses and green algae.
        Because they do not have true roots, non-vascular plants live in areas where there is a lot of water.

          The picture below shows various forms of both vascular and non-vascular plants commonly found
          in ponds.

            Great job! The emergent vegetation and rooted floating vegetation are likely to be vascular plants, because they both have roots.
            In addition, the floating vegetation has a flower, which is a characteristics of vascular plants.
            The emergent vegetation also appears to have seeds (in the things that look like corn dogs).
