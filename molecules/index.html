      <p>
        <b>What are Molecules?</b> Atoms can be attracted to other atoms. When this happens, they form groups of atoms
        called molecules. Molecules are two or more atoms that are bonded together through some attractive force (often,
        the <a target="_blank" href="../electric-force/index.html"><b>electric force</b></a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Molecules can be made of atoms of the same type. For example, an oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub>, is made of 2
        oxygen atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, molecules can be made of atoms of different types (or different elements). For example, a water molecule,
         H<sub>2</sub>O, is made of two different elements: hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We call molecules that are made of different elements "<b>compounds</b>." H<sub>2</sub>O and NaCl are
          both compounds. O<sub>2</sub> is not a compound, since it's only made of two oxygen atoms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>
        The number after each element shows the number of atoms of that element in the molecule. If there is no number
        after the element, that means there is just one atom of that element. For example, in H<sub>2</sub>O, the "2"
        after H means that there are 2 hydrogen atoms in a molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O. There are no numbers after "O,"
        which means there is just one oxygen atom.

        after the "O" means that there are two Oxygen atoms in this molecule). Below are two different ways of
        representing bonded Oxygen atoms that form the molecule O<sub>2</sub>. The picture on the left shows a very

      <p>
        The picture above on the right shows a more detailed model. Here, the "O"s (for "Oxygen") are shown in place
        of the nucleus. This is just a simpler way to represent the nucleus of an oxygen atom. The electrons (e-) from
        the oxygen atom on the left are shown as Xs and the electrons from the oxygen atom on the right are shown
        as dots.
      </p>
      <p>
        The electrons are shown along circles. You may have noticed that there are 4 electrons that are between the
        oxygen atoms (on the outside circles). The oxygen atoms "share" these 4 electrons.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note: The circle that each electron is associated with is not a physical "thing", but represents the amount

        oxygen's) that are in the Energy circle of each H atom. These four electrons are also in the oxygen atom's
        outer Energy circle. This means that sometimes these electrons "belong" to the hydrogen atoms and sometimes

        <b>Example 5: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> (sucrose, or common table sugar)</b>.
          A sugar molecule is much more complex! Sucrose, or common table sugar, has 12
          carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 11 oxygen atoms.

      <img style="display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"

      <p>
        The picture above to the right represents a molecule of sucrose (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)
        or "sugar". This way of representing a molecule is called a "ball and stick" model, where the balls represent
        the atoms, and the black "sticks" represent bonds between particular atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to understand that bonds between atoms—represented as "sticks" in this picture—are <b>not</b>
        material or physical objects or things with mass. Bonds are just attractive <i>forces</i> between two atoms
        (which <i>do</i> have mass), resulting from electric forces between charged particles (electrons and protons). 
      </p>
      <p>
        (A common misconception people have is that "energy" is "contained" or "stored" within bonds. This is false.
        Energy is an abstract measurement of the motion of objects or radiation.)

      <p><b>Why do atoms bond to form molecules?</b></p>

      <p>It
          may seem a bit strange, but atoms bond with each other because they "like" it when their
          outer Energy circle is full. (This is discussed more in the unit
          <a target="_blank" href="../atoms-electron-organization/index.html"><b>Atoms: Electron Organization</b></a>.)
          Energy circles are full when no more electrons can be in that Energy circle. Atoms are more stable when
          their outer Energy circle is full. 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The first Energy circle (E1) is full when there are 2 electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The second Energy circle (E2) is full when there are 8 electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The third Energy circle (E3) is full when there are 18 electrons.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>
        <b>Some bonding between atoms results from atoms having only one electron in the outer-most Energy circle.</b>
        To minimize (potential) energy, the electron may move from an Energy circle (or energy level) in one atom to
        another. Atoms may also <u>share</u> electrons with each other in order to fill up the outer Energy circles. 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Bonding Example 1: NaCl.</b> An atom of Na (sodium) has only one electron in its 3rd Energy circle. So,
          the electron moves from the Na (sodium) atom to the Cl (chlorine) atom. This is shown in the figure below
          (left). This electron now orbits around the Cl atom (shown below, right). As a result of losing an electron,
          the Na atom becomes positively charged. And, as a result of gaining an electron (which has a negative
          charge), the Cl atom becomes negatively charged. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <img style="text-align:center;display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto"
          src="NaCl_PosNegSides.png" alt="NaCl molecule with positive and negative sides" />

      <ul>
        <li>
          The <i>electric force</i> between the positively charged Na atom (Na+) and the negatively charged Cl atom
          (Cl-) pulls them together. Because of this, the Na and Cl atoms are attracted to each other. We say that
          they are "bonded". But this just means that the atoms are attracted to each other. The result of this bonding
          between atoms is the NaCl (or salt) molecule. 
        </li>
      </ul>

          Right! The Cl atom only needs one more electron to fill its outer energy circle. The Na atom only has one

          its electron to the Cl atom. Electrons have a negative charge. So, this transfer of the electron causes the

          In an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, Oxygen atoms have 6 electrons in their second (and outer) Energy circle.
          Oxygen "wants" 2 more electrons to complete that Energy circle. Each Hydrogen atom only has one electron,
          which is in the first Energy circle. So, the electron from each hydrogen atom is pulled into the outer
          Energy circle of the Oxygen atom to complete that Energy circle. 
          <br><br>
          The oxygen atom has eight protons and each hydrogen atom only has one proton. So, the oxygen nucleus pulls
          on the electrons more strongly than each hydrogen nucleus. As a result, the electrons are more often on the
          oxygen side of the molecule.

          The additional electrons cause the Oxygen to become more negatively
          charged and the Hydrogen atoms to become more positively charged. Due to electric forces,
          the (more positively charged) hydrogen atoms and the (more negatively charged) oxygen atom
          are attracted to each other. As a result, the three atoms are held together, forming a
          water molecule.

          Electrons may move from one atom to another atom in molecules. This results in molecules — including
          salt molecules, sugar molecules, and water molecules — having areas that are more positively charged and
          areas that are more negatively charged. This property of molecules, called polarity, helps other molecules
          with charged areas, like salt and sugar, dissolve in water.

          Right! This has to do with energy circles. Each hydrogen shares its electron with the oxygen atom. This
          completes the oxygen atom's outer energy circle. Because the electron spends more of its time in the
          oxygen's energy circle, the hydrogen sort of "loses" its electron and becomes positively charged.

        <b>Bonding Example 3: CO<sub>2</sub>.</b> In CO<sub>2</sub>, different atoms "share" electrons. Two of each of
        the oxygen's electrons (represented as dots below) orbit both the oxygen atom and the carbon atom. Also,
        four of the carbon atom's electrons (represented as "X"s below) orbit both the oxygen and carbon atoms. So,
        there is a lot of sharing of electrons in a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule! Now, all three atoms have two electrons
        in the closest Energy circle, and also share 8 electrons in the second Energy circle.

      <p>
        The oxygen atoms only need two more electrons to complete their outer Energy circle. But the carbon atom needs
        four more electrons to do that. So, the oxygen atoms are closer to having their second Energy circles completed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, oxygen atoms have 8 protons (each with a positive charge). Carbon atoms have 6 protons. So, electrons
        (which are negatively charged and attracted to positively charged protons) tend to be pulled to

        of the CO<sub>2</sub>molecules. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the oxygen atoms have more protons and pull harder on the electrons, the shared electrons spend more
        of their time in the oxygen atoms' Energy circles. As a result, the oxygen ends of the CO<sub>2</sub>
        molecules tend to be more negatively charged (represented as red in Figure 1 below). The carbon in the middle
        tends to be more positively charged (represented as blue in Figure 1 below).

        <b>(Slightly Advanced concept: Polarity)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Polarity.</b> When one side of a molecule has a positive charge and the opposite side has a negative
        charge, the molecule is considered to be "polar." Polar molecules attract the oppositely-charged parts of other
        polar molecules. Water molecules are polar molecules: the hydrogen sides are positively charged and the
        opposite (oxygen) sides are negatively charged. This is why they "stick" to other water molecules. (This is
        also why your hairs stick to each other when they are wet but not dry!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are two water molecules. The positively charged side of the first molecule and the negative side of the
        second molecule attract each other. These attractions allow water molecules to form droplets.
