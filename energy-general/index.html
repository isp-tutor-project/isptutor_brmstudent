    <div id="page1" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>Forms of energy.</b> There are different sources of energy (e.g., radiation from the sun, thermal energy of
        objects, wind energy, energy from moving water). But really, the two main "types" of energy are kinetic energy
        (energy due to motion) and potential energy (the potential for energy due to motion).
      </p>
      <p>
        Energy can be converted (or changed) from one form to another. This is important for people because it allows
        us to use the energy from sources like light, wind (kinetic energy of air molecules), and kinetic energy of
        water to generate electricity (movement of electrons) that we use for lots of things! Some devices that use
        electricity are shown below.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        When energy is converted to a different form, the total amount of energy must remain the same. This is a very
        important scientific principle called <b>Conservation of Energy.</b> According to the principle of conservation
        of energy, the total amount of energy always stays the same, including when energy is converted to a different
        form!
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples of energy changing forms:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Radiation from the sun (which is really the kinetic energy of photons) can be converted into thermal energy
          (the total amount of kinetic energy of the particles—atoms and/or molecules—that make up the object) when it
          hits an object. 
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              <b>Example 1:</b> Some of the light hitting an ice cube is absorbed by the molecules that make up the ice
              cube, making the molecules move faster. So, the thermal energy of the ice cube increases. Because the
              molecules that make up the ice cube move around faster when they absorb some of the light, the
              temperature of the ice cube will also increase. This is why the ice cube melts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Example 2:</b> Infrared radiation from the sun hits CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the Earth's
              atmosphere. This radiation energy changes to vibrational motion of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules
              (<a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../kinetic-and-potential-energy/">
                a form of Kinetic Energy
              </a>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The kinetic energy of objects can be converted into thermal energy.
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              <b>Example 3:</b> When you rub your hands together quickly, the (kinetic) energy of the movement of your
              hands is converted into the energy of motion of the molecules that make up your hands. As a result, you
              can feel your hands warm up because the thermal energy of your hands increases!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Energy is conserved!</b> In all of these examples, the total amount of energy before the conversion is equal
        to the total amount of energy afterward.

        <b>Energy is conserved! (This is important!)</b> Anytime that energy changes forms, the total amount of energy
        before the conversion is equal to the total amount of energy afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Conversion of Kinetic and Potential Energy.</b> Another way energy changes forms is between kinetic energy
        and potential energy. But the total amount of energy must remain the same at all times: this is the principle
        of <b>Conservation of Energy</b>

      <ul class="brm-list">

          <b>Example 4:</b> A roller coaster is at rest at the top of a hill (Time 1). At this time, it has no
          kinetic energy (because it is not moving). But it has potential energy because the earth's gravitational
          field is pulling down on it. The roller coaster will start to accelerate down the hill. As it does that,
          it will gain kinetic energy because its speed increases. But, it will lose potential energy because it's
          getting closer to the bottom of the hill (and so, there is less potential for gravity to pull it down). 
        </li>
        <li>
          When it reaches the very bottom of the hill (Time 2), it only has kinetic energy. It has no potential
          energy due to gravity because gravity does not have the potential to pull it down any farther.

          <img class="img-centered" src="RollerCoaster_revised copy.jpg" alt="roller coaster" />
        </li>
        <li>
          The opposite happens between Time 2 and when the coaster climbs to the top of the next hill (Time 3). Because
          it is slowing down between Time 2 and 3, its kinetic energy decreases. But because it's getting higher and
          higher, its potential energy increases! (The higher the coaster gets, the more potential it has for faster
          speed when it comes back down.)
        </li>
        <li>
          This is also an example of <b>Conservation of Energy</b>. According to this principle, energy is neither
          created nor destroyed. But it can change forms. In other words, the total amount of energy [of a system]
          does not change in time. So, we can look at the roller coaster at different points in time and know that
          the total energy is always the same:
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              Potential energy (Time 1) = Kinetic energy (Time 2) = Potential energy (Time 3) = Sum (PE + KE) at any
              time.  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Conservation of Energy principle is shown in the animation below. The total amount of energy is the same at
        each point in time. The total amount of energy, which is represented by the sum of the heights of the red bars,
        is always the same. Energy just converts from kinetic to potential energy and from potential to kinetic energy.
