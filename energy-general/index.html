      <p> <b>Forms of energy.</b> There are different sources of energy (e.g., radiation from the sun, thermal energy of objects, wind energy, energy from moving water). But really, the two main "types" of energy are kinetic energy (energy due to motion) and potential energy (the potential for energy due to motion). <br><br>Energy can be converted (or changed) from one form to another. This is important
        for people because it allows us to use the energy from sources like light, wind (kinetic energy of air molecules),
        and kinetic energy of water to generate electricity (movement of electrons) that we use for lots of things! Some
        devices that use electricity are shown below.

          <li>Radiation from the sun (which is really the kinetic energy of photons) can be converted into thermal energy (the total amount

            <li><b>Example 1:</b> Some of the light hitting an ice cube is absorbed by the molecules that make up the ice
              cube, making the molecules move faster. So, the thermal energy of the ice cube increases. Because the molecules
              that make up the ice cube move around faster when they absorb some of the light, the temperature of the ice
              cube will also increase. This is why the ice cube melts.</li>

                    This is correct! According to conservation of energy, total energy of the atom with electron before it moves to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward. 
                    This means that the photon must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost.

                <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
                    Well, actually, according to conservation of energy, the total energy of the atom with electron before it moves to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward. 
                    This means that the photon must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost. So, the answer here is (a).

                          <b>The reverse process can also happen: </b>Light
                            energy can be converted into kinetic energy of electrons. Light may hit electrons in certain
                            elements (such as the metals cesium and potassium) and molecules (such as chlorophyll molecules),
                            causing the electrons to escape from the atoms or molecules. As represented below, the amount
                            of kinetic energy of the escaped electrons is related to the energy of the light the electrons
                            absorb. Electrons that absorb higher-energy blue or violet light will have more kinetic energy
                            than electrons that absorb lower-energy green light. Red light, which has even less energy than
                            green light, doesn't have enough energy to allow electrons to escape from the metal.<br/>

              of the molecule (now called Adenosine Di-Phosphate, since there are only 2 Phosphates left). When this happens,
              the electrons in the freed Phosphate move to lower energy levels. This loss in energy is converted to energy
              of motion (or kinetic energy) of the freed Phosphate molecule.
