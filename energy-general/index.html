      <p> <b>Forms of energy.</b> There are different forms of energy (e.g., electromagnetic energy, thermal energy, kinetic
        energy, and potential energies). Energy can be converted (or changed) from one form to another. This is important
        for people because it allows us to use the energy from sources like light, wind (kinetic energy of air molecules),
        and kinetic energy of water to generate electricity (movement of electrons) that we use for lots of things! Some
        devices that use electricity are shown below.

            <li><b>Example 1:</b> Some of the light hitting an ice cube is absorbed by the molecules that make up the ice
              cube, making the molecules move faster. So, the thermal energy of the ice cube increases. Because the molecules

                    This is correct! According to conservation of energy, total energy of the atom with electron before it moves to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward. 
                    This means that the photon must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost.

                <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
                    Well, actually, according to conservation of energy, the total energy of the atom with electron before it moves to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward. 
                    This means that the photon must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost. So, the answer here is (a).

                          <b>The reverse process can also happen: </b>Light
                            energy can be converted into kinetic energy of electrons. Light may hit electrons in certain
                            elements (such as the metals cesium and potassium) and molecules (such as chlorophyll molecules),
                            causing the electrons to escape from the atoms or molecules. As represented below, the amount
                            of kinetic energy of the escaped electrons is related to the energy of the light the electrons
                            absorb. Electrons that absorb higher-energy blue or violet light will have more kinetic energy
                            than electrons that absorb lower-energy green light. Red light, which has even less energy than
                            green light, doesn't have enough energy to allow electrons to escape from the metal.<br/>

              bond the Phosphate molecules are at high energy levels. The Phosphate on the end may be pulled off of the rest
              of the molecule (now called Adenosine Di-Phosphate, since there are only 2 Phosphates left). When this happens,
              the electrons in the freed Phosphate move to lower energy levels. This loss in energy is converted to energy
              of motion (or kinetic energy) of the freed Phosphate molecule.
