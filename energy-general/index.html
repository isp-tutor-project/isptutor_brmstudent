        <b>Forms of energy.</b> There are different sources of energy (e.g., radiation from the sun, thermal energy of
        objects, wind energy, energy from moving water). But really, the two main "types" of energy are kinetic energy
        and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of an object due to its motion. Potential energy is an object's potential to have energy due to motion in the future.
      (Click <a class="brm-link" href="../kinetic-and-potential-energy/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.)

      <p>
        Energy can be converted (or changed) from one form to another. This is important for people because it allows
        us to use the energy from sources like light (kinetic energy of photons), wind (kinetic energy of air
        molecules), and kinetic energy of
        water to generate electricity (movement of electrons) that we use for lots of things! Some devices that use
        electricity are shown below.

     <br/>

      <p>
        When energy is converted to a different form, the total amount of energy must remain the same. This is a very
        important scientific principle called <b>Conservation of Energy.</b> According to the principle of conservation
        of energy, the total amount of energy always stays the same, including when energy is converted to a different
        form!

        <b>Examples of energy changing forms:</b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Radiation from the sun (which is really the kinetic energy of photons) can be converted into thermal energy
          (the total amount of kinetic energy of the particles — atoms and/or molecules — that make up the
          object) when it
          hits an object. 
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              <b>Example 1:</b> Some of the light hitting icicles is absorbed by the molecules that make up the icicles,
              making the molecules move faster. So, the thermal energy of the ice increases. Because the
              molecules that make up the ice move around faster when they absorb some of the light, the
              temperature of the ice will also increase. This is why the icicles melt.
            </li>

            <img class="img-centered img-size_med" src="SunMeltingIce_cropped.jpg"/>

           <br/>
            <li>
              <b>Example 2:</b> Infrared radiation from the sun hits CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the Earth's
              atmosphere. This radiation energy changes to vibrational motion of CO<sub>2</sub> molecules
              (<a class="brm-link" href="../kinetic-and-potential-energy/" target="_blank">a form of Kinetic
                Energy</a>). Soon, it converts back to infrared radiation, which may then be converted to thermal
              energy.
            </li>

            <img class="img-centered img-size" src="CO2_vibrational_infrared.png"/>

          </ul>
        </li>
       <br/>
        <li>

          The kinetic energy of objects can be converted into thermal energy.
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              <b>Example 3:</b> When you rub your hands together quickly, the (kinetic) energy of the movement of your
              hands is converted into the energy of motion of the molecules that make up your hands. As a result, you
              can feel your hands warm up because the thermal energy of your hands increases!
            </li>
          </ul>

        <b>Energy is conserved! (This is important!)</b> Anytime that energy changes forms, the total amount of energy
        before the conversion is equal to the total amount of energy afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Conversion of Kinetic and Potential Energy.</b> Another way energy changes forms is between kinetic energy
        and potential energy. But the total amount of energy must remain the same at all times: this is the principle
        of <b>Conservation of Energy</b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Example 4:</b> A roller coaster is at rest at the top of a hill (Time 1). At this time, it has no
          kinetic energy (because it is not moving). But it has potential energy because the earth's gravitational
          field is pulling down on it. The roller coaster will start to accelerate down the hill. As it does that,
          it will gain kinetic energy because its speed increases. But, it will lose potential energy because it's
          getting closer to the bottom of the hill (and so, there is less potential for gravity to pull it down). 
        </li>
        <li>
          When it reaches the very bottom of the hill (Time 2), it only has kinetic energy. It has no potential
          energy due to gravity because gravity does not have the potential to pull it down any farther.

          <img alt="roller coaster" class="img-centered img-size" src="RollerCoaster_PE_KE_final.jpg"/>
        </li>
        <li>
          The opposite happens between Time 2 and when the coaster climbs to the top of the next hill (Time 3). Because
          it is slowing down between Time 2 and 3, its kinetic energy decreases. But because it's getting higher and
          higher, its potential energy increases! (The higher the coaster gets, the more potential it has for faster
          speed when it comes back down.)
        </li>
        <li>
          This is also an example of <b>Conservation of Energy</b>. According to this principle, energy is neither
          created nor destroyed. But it can change forms. In other words, the total amount of energy [of a system mdash in this case, the roller coaster]
          does not change in time. So, we can look at the roller coaster at different points in time and know that
          the total energy is always the same:
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              Total energy (Time 1) = Total energy (Time 2) = Total energy (Time 3) = Sum (PE + KE) at any
              time.

          its height above the earth), and at its highest point after it bounces, it will again only have potential
          energy (the same as its initial). So, the ball will return to 1 meter.

              temporarily. But these electrons will quickly move back to the lower Energy circle. When this happens,

              electromagnetic radiation). This process is represented in the picture below. </li>

          This is correct! According to conservation of energy, total energy of the atom with electron before it moves
          to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward.
          This means that the photon must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost.
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
          Well, actually, according to conservation of energy, the total energy of the atom with electron before it
          moves to the lower energy level must be the same as the total energy afterward. This means that the photon
          must be the exact same energy as the amount of energy the electron lost. So, the answer here is (a).

        <b>We just saw how the energy of electrons can be converted into light energy. But the reverse process can also
          happen: </b>Light energy can be converted into kinetic energy of electrons. Light may hit electrons in certain
        elements (such as the metals cesium and potassium) and molecules (such as chlorophyll molecules),
        causing the electrons to escape from the atoms or molecules. As represented below, the amount
        of kinetic energy of the escaped electrons is related to the energy of the light the electrons
        absorb. Electrons that absorb higher-energy blue or violet light will have more kinetic energy
        than electrons that absorb lower-energy green light. Red light, which has even less energy than
        green light, doesn't have enough energy to allow electrons to escape from the metal.

          <b>Conversion of kinetic energy of electrons into kinetic energy of molecules (ATP).</b> Another important
          way that energy may be conserved happens when electrons move to lower
          <a class="brm-link" href="../energylevel/index.html" target="_blank">energy levels</a>
          in molecules that break apart during chemical reactions. Because energy must be conserved,
          one or more of the resulting molecules may have a greater kinetic energy. This happens with a molecule called
          ATP, which is a very important molecule because it is a source of energy in animals and plant cells. ATP
          stands for "Adenosine Tri-Phosphate." It is a fairly complex molecule, so we show a simplified picture of
          its main parts below: Adenosine and three Phosphate (P) molecules.

          Each Phosphate molecule has one phosphorus atom that is bonded with four oxygen atoms. The electrons that
          bond the Phosphate molecules are at high energy levels. The Phosphate on the end may be pulled off of the
          rest of the molecule (now called Adenosine Di-Phosphate, since there are only 2 Phosphates left). When this
          happens, the electrons in the freed Phosphate move to lower energy levels. This loss in energy is converted
          to energy of motion (or kinetic energy) of the freed Phosphate molecule.
