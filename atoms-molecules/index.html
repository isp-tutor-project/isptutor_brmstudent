      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p>
        All matter—desks, books, clothes, and even your body, as well as all other animals and plants—is made up of
        atoms. Atoms are very tiny. For example, if you had a very powerful microscope, you could “zoom” in on one cell
        of your body. In the picture below, one cell in the arm of the boy is magnified (the second picture below).
        If you keep zooming in more and more, then you would be able to see DNA molecules that are in the cells.
        (This is shown in the third picture below.) The individual atoms that make DNA molecules are represented as the
        lighter and darker blue and black spheres. One of the atoms (hydrogen) that makes up a DNA molecule is
        represented on the far right.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Atoms are the smallest units of matter that can exist by themselves or in combination with other atoms. Smaller
        units of matter—such as electrons, protons, and neutrons—generally do not exist (for a very long time) on their
        own; they quickly combine with other particles that are nearby to form atoms! (By the end of this unit, you
        should have some idea why.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, atoms are often called the “building blocks” of all matter. Atoms combine with other atoms
        to make molecules (including DNA), and more complex structures like chromosomes, cells, your body, and
        everything else in the universe!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why should I care about atoms?</b> Because atoms make up just about everything, it is very important to have
        a basic understanding of atoms. It's important to understand what atoms are made of and the forces
        that keep atoms together and let them bond with other atoms to make larger objects (including DNA molecules,
        different types of crystals such as salt and sugar, etc.).

        <b>Parts of atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons.</b> All atoms have a nucleus, which is the center of the
        atom. The nucleus of atoms is made of protons and neutrons. Atoms also have electrons, which are much smaller
        than protons or neutrons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Electrons orbit—or move around—the nucleus at very high speeds. Two different kinds of atoms (or elements) are
        shown below. The atom on the left (hydrogen) has one proton and one electron. Hydrogen is the only type of
        atom/element that does not have any neutrons in its nucleus. The atom on the right (an oxygen atom) has 8
        protons, 8 electrons, and 8 neutrons (some protons and neutrons are not visible).
      </p>

      <p>
        Important note: In the figure above, the circles around the atoms don't actually exist. The circles are called
        "Energy circles." These Energy circles represent about how much energy the electrons on that circle have
        (due to their motion and their potential for even more motion). The actual paths or orbitals of electrons in
        atoms can be very complex.

        <b>Electric force.</b> Particles that have opposite charges (e- and p+) attract each other. Particles that
        have the same charge repel (or push each other away). This means that protons (p+), which are positively
        charged, repel each other. Also, electrons (e-), which are negatively charged, repel each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call the force between charged particles the "electric force." The electric force is named after electrons.

        Because of the electric force, electrons and protons attract each other.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Electrons orbit around the nucleus because of the attractive electric force between electrons and protons.
          In other words, the protons pull the electrons toward them, keeping the electrons orbiting around the
          nucleus. (But electrons and protons don't collide with each other for complex reasons not discussed here.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This is kind of like our solar system, where the sun is the nucleus in the center and the planets are like
          the electrons. Just like the pull from gravity causes the planets to orbit around the sun, the electric
          force's pull between oppositely-charged particles causes the electrons to orbit around the nucleus.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because of the electric force, electrons repel (or push away) other electrons.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>This is why electrons are pretty spread out in atoms.</li>

        Finally, protons repel other protons because of the electric force.

      <ul>
        <li>
          You may wonder why protons stay together in the nucleus then. Neutrons actually hold protons together in
          the nucleus by another type of force, called the "strong" force. This type of force is more advanced, though.
          (You may learn more about the strong force in high school or college; or, you can do some research on your
          own to learn about it if you want.)

        <b>Why the electric force is important.</b> The electric force is very important to understand because it
        is responsible for atoms to even exist!! Our bodies (which are made of lots of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen
        atoms) would not exist if it were not for the electric force! Trees and other plants would not exist! Animals
        would not exist! Planets would not exist! (You get the idea.)

      <p>
        The electric force is also responsible for a lot of things you may not have realized.

          For example, the "stickiness" you feel on your fingers after you eat a piece of sugary candy is caused

      <ul>
        <li>
          The little shock you get when you touch a door knob (especially if the air is dry) is caused by electric
          forces.

          If you rub a balloon on your hair, your hair will "stick" to the balloon. This is because when the balloon
          material rubbed your hair, electrons (e-) from your hair moved to the balloon. Now the balloon is negatively
          charged, which is shown by the minus (-) signs on the balloon. The minus signs (-) mean that there are
          electrons on the balloon (since electrons are negatively charged). Your hair is positively charged.

        <b>Masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons.</b> Many people do not understand that all atoms—even the
        smallest ones that make up air—have some mass and weight! These masses are very small, and people might not be
        able to detect their mass, but they are made of matter. And all matter has mass! When you feel the wind (moving
        air) hitting your face, you can feel this because the atoms (and groups of atoms, called molecules) that make
        up the air have some mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parts of atoms have masses (even though they are very very very small, from a human's point of view!).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Protons and neutrons have about the same mass (and weight). The mass of one proton or neutron is what
          scientists call one "atomic mass unit" or "amu" (pronounced "AY-EM-YOU"). One amu is equal to
          0.00000000000000000000000166 grams. This is so small, we can't feel the mass (or weight) of one proton or
          neutron. But, they do have SOME mass (and weight).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An electron has even <b>less</b> mass than a proton or neutron, or about 1/1837 the mass (and weight) of a
          proton or neutron. This means it takes 1,837 electrons to equal the mass of just one proton or neutron.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <p>
        The relative masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons are represented below (as a proportion of their volume):

      <br>

      <p>
        The mass of an atom is the sum of the masses of its three parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. So, if you
        know how many protons, neutrons, and electrons an atom has, you can figure out the mass of the atom.
        Or, you can just look up the mass of different types of atoms in the Periodic table of elements.
