            <h1>Light/Electromagnetic Radiation</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">

      <p>
        <b>What is electromagnetic radiation?</b> Electromagnetic radiation includes light and other "rays" from the
        sun that reach the earth. These rays includes radiation that have different amount of energies. (See the
        picture below.) The sun sends out lower-energy radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, and infrared
        (pronounced: in-fra-RED) radiation. ("Infrared" is from the Latin: "Infra" meaning "below" and "red" as in the
        color red. :-).) Infrared radiation is lower in energy than red visible light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture below shows these and other types of electromagnetic radiation, ordered from lowest to highest
        energy (high-frequency radiation has more energy than lower-frequency radiation).
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img alt="The Electromagnetic Spectrum" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="EM_Spectrum3-new-A2-T1revised.jpg"/>

      <p>
        The middle-energy radiation from the sun that we are able to see is what we call visible light. And the sun
        emits higher-energy radiation called ultravioletradiation. (Ultraviolet is from the Latin: "Ultra" meaning
        "beyond" and "violet" as in the color violet.) So, ultraviolet radiation is higher in energy than violet
        visible light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sun also emits even higher-energy radiation: X-rays and Gamma rays. The very high-energy gamma rays are
        what made David Banner the Incredible Hulk in comic books. But in reality, exposure to gamma radiation will
        cause you lots of health problems! Fortunately for us, the Earth's atmosphere filters out this high-energy
        radiation from the Sun.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">

      <p>
        <b>Waves and Wavelengths.</b> All radiation travels in a wave-like pattern, like shown below. The
        wave-like movement, or "cycling", from the peak to the trough and returning up to the peak is one "wave" or
        one "cycle." The length of one "wave" is called the "wavelength." One wavelength is the straight-line
        distance between two adjacent peaks (shown below). 
      </p>

      <img alt="light wave" class="img-centered img-size_smaller" src="Wavelength.png"/>

      <p>
        Different types of radiation have different wavelengths. Radio waves have longer wavelengths than microwaves;
        microwaves have longer wavelengths than infrared radiation; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Wavelengths of visible light.</b> Just like with the different types of radiation (ultraviolet, infrared,
        etc.), the wavelengths of visible light vary as well. As shown below, light travels in a wave-like form. One
        wavelength of each color of light is highlighted in the picture below. For example, violet has a wavelength of
        400 nm (nanometers). One nanometer is equal to 0.000000001 meters, or one-billionth of a meter
        (10<sup>-9</sup> meters).
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart below shows differences in the wavelengths of various colors of light in the visible spectrum (of
        course, the wavelengths of actual light are much, much, much, much smaller!). But this is to give you some
        idea about how the wavelengths of different colors of light compare to each other.

          That's correct! Violet light has the most energy of all the colors of visible light. You may notice that the violet light
          moves up and down more than the other colors of light over the same distance. This is what gives the
          violet light the most energy.

<b>Just how small is 405 nanometers (the wavelength of violet light)?</b>
       <br/><br/>
        405 nm is equal to 405 × 10<sup>-9</sup> meters. This is equal to about 4 × 10<sup>-7</sup> meters.
        Looking at the electromagnetic spectrum picture above, this is about the size of a one-celled animal, like
        an amoeba.
     <br/><br/>

        You can imagine this length by taking a meter stick and looking at one centimeter, which is about half the
        diameter of a penny (see below). One centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter (or 10<sup>-2</sup> meters).
        Then divide the centimeter by 10, which is one millimeter, or one-thousandth of a meter
        (10<sup>-3</sup> meters). In the picture below, one millimeter is the distance between the shortest lines on
        the ruler or 1/10th of a centimeter.

     <br/><br/>
        Then divide the millimeters into about 1,000 more parts. That distance would be too small for your eyes to
        detect. But it will <i>still</i> be a bit longer than the wavelength of violet light! In fact, that will
        be longer than even the wavelength of red light, which has the longest wavelength!

        <b>Frequency:</b> The frequency of a particular type of light is the number of wavelengths the light travels
        in one second (or the number of cycles of the light per second). The frequency of light is measured in
        Hertz (Hz). For example, the frequency of infrared light is 10<sup>12</sup> Hz. This means that in one second,
        infrared light cycles through 10<sup>12</sup> (or 1,000,000,000,000) wavelengths!
      </p>
      <p>
     <br/>
        <b>Relationship between wavelength and frequency.</b> You <u>might</u> think that radiation that has longer
        wavelengths might travel faster. (Do you?)
      </p>
      <p>
        But actually, all forms of radiation travel at the same speed (about 3x10<sup>8</sup> meters per second, or
        about 300,000,000 m/s), regardless of wavelength. So, the speed of violet light is the same as the speed of
        red light, which is also the same as the speed of ultraviolet radiation, gamma rays, and (at the other extreme
        lower end of wavelengths), radio waves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because all light travels at the same speed, it takes less time for shorter-wavelength radiation to move a
        distance of one wavelength and it takes more time for longer-wavelength radiation (for example, radio waves)
        to move a distance of one wavelength. Scientists call the time it takes for light to travel a distance of
        one wavelength (or one cycle) its period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Period:</b> The period of a light wave is the time it takes the light to travel one cycle (or one
        wavelength). The period is inversely related to the frequency: p = 1/f. This also means that the frequency
        is inversely related to the period: f = 1/p. 
      </p>

     <br/>
      <img alt="Light wave" class="img-centered img-size" src="PeriodDefWavelength.JPG"/>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Because all light travels at the same speed, light with longer wavelengths (like infrared and red light) has
        lower frequencies. And light with shorter wavelengths (like violet visible light and ultraviolet radiation) has
        higher frequencies.

        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Speed of light.</b> We can figure out the speed of light using the basic definition of speed: the distance
        an object moves divided by the time it takes the object to move that distance. 
      </p>
      <p style="color:#9900ff">
        Analogy: To make this section a little easier to understand, let's think about someone walking. And let's
        say that each step they take is equal to one meter. Also, it takes them one second to take each step. So,
        this person moves one meter in one second. And their speed is simply one meter per second. It was
        calculated as:
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered" style="color:#9900ff">
        Speed = distance (per step) / time (per step).
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        For light, speed can be calculated as the distance light travels divided by the time light takes to travel
        that distance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because one wavelength is the basic unit of distance for light (like one step was in the analogy above), we
        can use that as the distance light travels. The light will travel that distance (one wavelength) in one period.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we write the speed of light as:
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered" style="color:#0000ff">
        Speed of light = One wavelength (meters)/period (seconds)
      </p>
      <p>
        The period is the time light takes to travel one cycle (one wave). The inverse of the period (1/period) is
        the number of cycles (or waves) that light travels in one second. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of cycles that light travels in one second is called its "frequency." So, we can replace the
        period in the equation above with the frequency.
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered" style="color:#0000ff">
        Speed of light = One wavelength (meters) x frequency (cycles per second)
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the speed of light is the same for all types of light, light that has longer wavelengths
        (such as red light) must have a lower frequency than light with shorter wavelengths (such as violet light).
      </p>
      <p>
     <br/>
        <b>Calculating the frequency of light.</b>  We know (from experiments) that light travels at about
        3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters/second. We also know the wavelengths of different types of light. So, we can
        calculate the frequencies for different types of lights. Let's look at red light.
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">
        <span style="color:#0000ff">3 x 10<sup>8 </sup>m/s = 6.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup> m ×</span>
        <span style="color:rgb(0,0,255)"> frequency</span>
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 x 10<sup>-7</sup> m:
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered" style="color:#0000ff">
        .46 x 10<sup>15 </sup>cycles/second = 4.6 x 10<sup>14</sup> cycles/second = frequency
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that in just one second, red light cycles 4.6 x 10<sup>14</sup> times! In other words, in just one
        second, red light travels through 4.6 x 10<sup>14</sup> waves! Pretty fast!!
