      <p>
        In contrast to most Angiosperms, <b>Gymnosperms</b> (from Greek, gym means “naked” and sperm means “seed”) do
        not have flowers. Gymnosperms are plants that produce their seeds in cones. 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The seeds in gymnosperms are “naked,” or are not surrounded by fruit. Their seeds are wedged between the
          woody “scales” of the cones. The picture below shows a pine cone and some seeds from the pine cone (to the
          right of the cone). 

          <img class="img-centered" src="PineConeSeedsLarger.jpg" width="400" height="301" alt="pine cone seeds" />
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Gymnosperms include pine trees conifers, cycads, Ginkgo and Maidenhair trees, to name a few. (See the picture
        below for examples of gymnosperms.)
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img class="img-centered" src="Gymnosperm3.jpg" width="800" alt="Different types of Gymnosperms" />

      <p>
        Conifers are one type of gymnosperm, plants that produce seeds in cones. Conifers are woody plants with
        scale-like leaves or needles (as shown in the picture below, left).  Conifers include: cedars, Douglas firs,
        cypresses, firs, junipers, kauri, larches, pines, hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and yews.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Life Cycle of Gymnosperms.</b> A mature gymnosperm tree generally has both female and male
          cones.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we call pine cones (see the picture above, left) are the tree's female reproductive organs.
          In a mature pine cone, egg cells are formed at the base of the scaly leaf-like structures
          (near the center of the cone). (The pinkish areas in the middle picture below show about
          where the eggs are.)
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img class="img-centered" src="PineConesCombinedOPt1.jpg" alt="pine cones" />
      <br/>

      <p>
        Gymnosperms also have male pollen-producing organs (pollen cones, shown below), which are soft and form in
        clusters. The male cones are located lower on the tree than female cones; this makes within-tree pollination
        less likely. The wind moves pollen through the air to nearby trees. Pollen that lands near an egg between the
        scaly leaves of a mature female pine cone will form a tunnel to the center of the egg and fertilize it.
        
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="MalePineCones.jpg" width="500">

      <br> 
       Fertilized eggs become seeds, which contain a plant embryo. Some time later, the scaly leaves of the pine
        cones open up and the seeds are blown away by the wind, where (if lucky) they will grow into trees.
