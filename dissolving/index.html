        <b>What happens to something when it dissolves?</b> When you add sugar to a drink like lemonade or iced tea and
        mix it around, the sugar will dissolve in the drink. This means that the little grains of sugar will break into
        smaller and smaller sugar particles. Eventually, the sugar may break down into single molecules of sugar and
        spread throughout the drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, as shown below, brown sugar was added to a glass of water. At first it sank to the bottom of the
        water (below, left picture). After the water was stirred, the brown sugar is no longer visible. It has
        dissolved, or broken down into particles that are too small to see. In the picture below and to the right, you can no longer see the brown sugar after it has dissolved in water.

        In general, a solid substance added to a liquid <b>dissolves</b> when the atoms or molecules of the solid break
        away from the solid substance and become spread throughout the liquid.

      <ul class="brm-list">

          We call the liquid that something dissolves in the "solute." Water is often a solute that substances like
          salts or sugars dissolve in. Water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) are able to dissolve these substances because
          each H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is positively charged (+) on one end and negatively (-) charged on the opposite
          end. So, water molecules can pull on other charged particles, making them break apart. A water molecule is
          shown below.

          We call the substance that dissolves the "solvent." Salt (such as sodium chloride, NaCl) is one solvent that
          dissolves in a solute (such as water). NaCl can dissolve in water because each NaCl molecule has a positively
          charged side (+) and a negatively charged side (-). This is shown below.

        <b>Salt dissolving in water.</b> When table salt (NaCl) is added to water, some H<sub>2</sub>O molecules will
        pull on the atoms of salt (both the positively charged sodium, Na+ ions and negatively charged chlorine, Cl-
        ions) that are on the outer surface of the salt crystals. The negatively charged sides of the water molecules
        will surround the Na+ ions (which is positively charged (+) because it had lost its electron to the Cl atom) and pull the Na+ ions away from the Cl- ion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the positive sides of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules surround the negatively charged Cl- ions and pull the
        Cl- ions from the Na+ ions. This is how the Na+ and Cl- ions break away from the NaCl crystals and spread
        throughout the water.

        <b>Carbon dioxide dissolved in water.</b> Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) molecules can be dissolved in
        liquids, including in water. This causes the "fizziness" of drinks like soda. CO<sub>2</sub> can dissolve in
        water because CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are attracted to oppositely charged parts of each
        other. These attractions help to "hold" the CO<sub>2</sub> in the water. The picture below on the left shows a
        simplified image of how electric forces from H<sub>2</sub>O molecules may "hold" CO<sub>2</sub> in the liquid.
        Note that oppositely-charged areas of the CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are attracted to each
        other. The picture below on the right shows a slightly more complex image of how H<sub>2</sub>O molecules might
        surround CO<sub>2</sub> molecules in the water. Some people say that the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules form "cages"
        around each CO<sub>2</sub> molecule.
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="co2inwatercombined_PlusMinus.jpg" width="800"
           alt="co2inwatercombined_PlusMinus" />

      <p>
        CO<sub>2</sub> is also kept in the soda because there is a high pressure from the air above the soda in the
        bottle before it is opened. This high pressure helps keep the CO<sub>2</sub> that is near the surface of the
        soda from "escaping" the liquid and into the trapped air in the bottle.  
      </p>

      <br>
      <img class="img-centered" src="SodaBottle.png" alt="soda bottle"/>
      <br>

      <p>
        Once you open the bottle, the high-pressure air at the top of the bottle is released into the (lower-pressure)
        atmosphere. As a result, there is now less pressure from air at the surface of the soda. Because of this, some
        CO<sub>2</sub> may be able to "escape" from the soda. When this happens, sometimes enough CO<sub>2</sub> 
        escapes that the CO<sub>2</sub> also pushes some of the bubbly liquid out with it. This has probably happened
        to you (from time to time) when you open a bottle of soda.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you shake a bottle of soda before opening it (which I do not recommend!), some of the CO<sub>2</sub> 
        molecules will group together to form larger bubbles in the soda. When this happens, the CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles
        have more mass and are better able to break through H<sub>2</sub>O--H<sub>2</sub>O bonds in the liquid above
        them to escape into the atmosphere. This is why when you shake the soda bottle before opening it, the soda will
        probably "explode" out of the bottle. You'll have a big mess to clean up!

        <b>Saturation point.</b> There is a limit to how much of a substance (such as table salt,
        NaCl) can dissolve in water. For example, if you are adding salt to water in a glass, and keep stirring the
        water, eventually no more salt will break up and dissolve. This is called the <b>saturation point</b>. The
        saturation point in salt water happens when there are JUST enough H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to surround and
        hold up all the (heavier) Na+ and Cl- atoms in the water. (This idea is represented below.)

          Well, actually, the graph shows that, as the temperature increases (as we move from left to right on the
          x-axis), there is very little change of solubility (or increase along the y-axis).

        Let's think more about what happens to a glass of salt water after 3 weeks...

        <b>Q6: You add 38g (grams) of NaCl to 100 g of water, which is the saturation point (no more NaCl can dissolve
          in the water). After 3 weeks, half of the water evaporates (so there is now 50g of water). What will happen
          to the Na+ and Cl- atoms in the water?</b>

          Right! The Na+ and Cl- atoms will stay in the water. Compared to the lighter H2O molecules, Na+ and Cl- atoms
          are too heavy to evaporate.

          Right! The salt water was at the saturation point first. But then, some water evaporated. So, after 3 weeks,
          the concentration of Na and Cl in the water is higher than it was. Now, there is more Na and Cl in the water
          than the water molecules can surround and hold up.
