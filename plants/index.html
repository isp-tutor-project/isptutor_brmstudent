        <b>What are Plants?</b> Plants are living organisms composed of one or more cells. A cell is the
smallest unit that can be said to be alive. Some plants &mdash;such as some types of algae&mdash; are a single cell. (Similarly, some animals, like amoebas, are a single cell.)
        </p>
        <p>Like animal cells,
        each plant cell has a nucleus (see the picture of a plant cell below). Having a cell nucleus is a key
        characteristic of all living things.
      </p>
      <p>
        One difference between plant and animal cells is that the cells of plants have "walls", which are rigid
        and firm. Animal cells do not have cell walls but thinner cell membranes. This makes sense because plants
        do not have skeletons that support them. If plant cells did not have firm cell walls, plants would be more
        or less shapeless blobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the cell shown below, you can put the cursor on the red triangles to see a description of the tiny organs ("organelles") and
        other substances inside the cell.

      is to make very important molecules called proteins. Proteins are made in cell organelles called ribosomes (not shown above).
Proteins do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, 
function, and regulation of the plant (or animal).

      <p>
        Plants usually grow in one location (rather than move around, like
        most animals do). Because of this, plants must depend on their local environment for nourishment. Plants get
        some nutrients they need through the absorption of water and minerals through their roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scientifically, we say plants are organisms that are <b>autotrophic</b>. <i>Auto</i> means "self" and
        <i>trophic</i> means "food" or "nutrition" (in Greek). So, <b>autotrophic</b> means that plants make
        their own food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plants make their own food (sugars) through the process of
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../photosynthesis/">photosynthesis</a>. 
        In this process, sunlight provides the energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars. This process
        happens in the chloroplasts in the cells of plant leaves (shown in the picture of a plant cell below).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are plants made of?</b> Most people would be surprised to learn that plants are mostly made from
        carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which comes from the air!!  This is why plants (including trees) are so
        important to our environment: they remove CO<sub>2</sub> (a gas that absorbs energy from sunlight) from the air.
        This helps keep the Earth from getting too warm.

        <b>Plants</b> can be divided into two main groups: Vascular and Non-vascular. (See the diagram below.)
      </p>

      <ul class="list-no-bullets">
        <li>
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../vascular-plants/">Vascular plants</a>
          have cells that form tubes for carrying water and nutrients throughout the plant.
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../non-vascular-plants/">Non-vascular plants</a>
          do not have tubes to carry water and nutrients. Instead, water and nutrients move from cells to their
          neighboring cells. In case you were wondering, this is why (as shown in the picture of the plant cell two
          pages ago) the cell walls have little holes in them. This is so water and other nutrients can move from
          cell to cell.

          Humans are more like vascular plants because both humans and vasular plants have tubes that carry water
          and nutrients throughout
          their bodies. In humans, we call these arteries and veins.
