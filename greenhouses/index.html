          known as a glass house, hot house, or a conservatory (e.g., Phipps Conservatory, shown
          below)—has walls and a roof often made of glass. However, they can also be made of a heavy plastic. Both glass and plastic are <a target='_blank' href='../thermal-conductors-vs-thermal-insulators/index.html'><b><font
            color='#0000ff'>thermal insulators</font></b></a>, meaning that thermal energy is not easily transferred through their materials. 
          Greenhouses are made of materials that are thermal insulators that help them stay at the same temperature. Greenhouses also have heating and cooling equipment to help them stay at a constant temperature. This
          protects plants from outside weather conditions and controls the environment of the plants.
        </font></span>In addition to the temperature, the humidity, amount of light,
        and other conditions are controlled to protect plants and help them grow.</span></p>

    <font size='3'><b>History of Greenhouses</b></font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font size='3'>Greenhouses were originally developed in Rome around 30 AD. They were created for the emperor’s
      health and were called speculariums. The first “modern” botanical greenhouse (or greenhouse
      for plants) is considered Leiden, Holland and the work of Jules Charles in 1599. He created
      this to raise tropical plants for medicines. They grew larger in the 17th century. Some say
      George Washington had a greenhouse on his property to grow pineapples. </font>
  </p>
  <p><span style='background-color:transparent'>The Wye Orangery, built in 1785 on
      a plantation on Maryland’s eastern shore, is America’s only remaining 18th century greenhouse.
      The plantation itself is recognized as the place where Frederick Douglass spent a portion
      of his slave years. Frederick Douglass wrote in his famous memoir of his life as a slave
      that this greenhouse “…abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple
      of the north to the delicate orange of the south.”</span></p>

              Right! If the local environment is not suitable for growth of a plant, for example, it is too cold or too hot, then it would need to be grown in a greenhouse.

              Actually, if the local environment is not suitable for growth of a plant, for example, it is too cold or too hot, then it would need to be grown in a greenhouse.

    </font></b><p><span style='background-color:transparent'>Artifacts (including dishes,
      teacups, cutlery, as well as religious artifacts) not only indicate that slaves were the
      individuals responsible for maintaining greenhouses—like keeping the fires going to maintain
      the temperature—but that they also lived there. There is also evidence that the slaves experimented
      with developing plants for food, medicinal, and other purposes in this greenhouse.</span></p>
  <p><span style='background-color:transparent'>In the mid-1800s during the Victorian
      age, greenhouses became very popular not only for growing plants but also to help people
      reconnect to nature in often overcrowded urban areas.</span></p>
