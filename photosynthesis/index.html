      <p>
        <b>Photosynthesis is important!</b> As I'm sure you know, people and other animals need oxygen to live.
        Without oxygen, we're all in trouble! How do we get oxygen? A major source of oxygen comes from plants.
        Oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub>) are made during the process of photosynthesis, which occurs in plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>But what is Photosynthesis?</b> Unlike animals, plants can make their own food (sugars). The process by
        which food (sugar) is made in plants is called <b>photosynthesis</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break the word down into its Latin roots:</p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li><i>Photo</i> means light (as in "photons" or "photography": making pictures with light).</li>
        <li><i>Synthesis</i> means to put together or combine (like when you "synthesize" information).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So, photosynthesis means to "put together by light."
      </p>
      <p>
        Photosynthesis is a 
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../chemicalvs-physicalreactions/">chemical process</a>.
        During photosynthesis, sunlight is one source of energy for the atoms in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) 
        and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecules to combine (synthesize) to make sugar molecules. Oxygen molecules
        (O<sub>2</sub>) are also made during photosynthesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sugars produced are used by plants as their food to help them grow and other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photosynthesis is a very complicated process. In this unit, we will simplify it and discuss the main steps
        involved. The chemical equation below shows a simplified summary of the process of photosynthesis:
        CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O are eventually converted into glucose (and other sugars) and oxygen.

        <b>Steps of Photosynthesis.</b> To make sugars, plants need sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (and a bunch
        of other things we won't worry about now). Let’s learn some important steps of photosynthesis:
      </p>

      <img style="margin:5px 10px;float:right" src="Photosynthesis3.png.jpg" width="500">

      <ol class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <span style="color:#9900ff">Carbon dioxide</span> passes from the air into small openings in the bottom of
          leaves called stomata.
        </li>
        <li>
          The roots absorb <span style="color:#0000ff"><b>water</b></span>, which travels through vessels in the
          stem and to the leaves. Water is necessary for photosynthesis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sunlight is absorbed by molecules in the leaves called 
          <b><span style="color:rgb(0,176,80)">chlorophyll</span></b>. Chlorophyll is what gives the leaves their
          green color. Chlorophyll is found within the special organelles (little organs) of the plant cell called
          <b>chloroplasts,</b> which are in the leaves and other parts of the plant.
        </li>
        <li>
          The energy from light causes chlorophyll molecules to lose electrons. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Chlorophyll molecules then become positively charged. Chlorophyll molecules are really
          really good at pulling electrons from other molecules (due to both the
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../electric-force/index.html">electric force</a>
          and atoms in chlorophyll molecules
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../atoms-electron-organization/">
            "wanting" complete energy circles
          </a>). So, chlorophyll molecules end up pulling electrons from nearby
          <span style="color:#0000ff"><b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b></span> (water) molecules.
        </li>
        <li>
          This causes the <span style="color:#0000ff"><b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b></span> molecules to split into
          oxygen and hydrogen atoms (another chemical reaction). Free oxygen atoms from this process combine to make
          an oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub>. Each hydrogen atom has lost an electron to the chlorophyll molecule,
          making it positively charged (H<sup>+</sup>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is a "waste product" of this reaction and is not used by plants. O<sub>2</sub> is
          released from the small holes at the bottom of leaves (the stomata) into the
          atmosphere. But this is good news for people and animals!
        </li>
        <li>
          Hydrogen and <span style="color:#9900ff">carbon dioxide</span> are used in the process of making
          <b>glucose</b> and other sugars that are food for the plant. Two different ways of representing a glucose
          molecule are shown below. The glucose that is produced also goes into making the rigid cell walls of plants.
          Glucose is stored for future use in the plant’s leaves, roots, or fruit (which we may like to eat because
          it is sweetened by glucose!).
        </li>
        <li>
          Another molecule, called ATP, is also made during photosynthesis.
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../food/">ATP molecules</a> 
          are one source of energy for the chemical reactions in photosynthesis. ATP molecules also provide
          energy for the growth and development of plants.

        <b>Variables that affect the rate of photosynthesis:</b> There are several factors that affect the rate of
        photosynthesis (or how fast photosynthesis happens in plants). These include: (a) light intensity (brightness),
        (b) carbon dioxide concentration, (c) temperature, and (d) 
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../light/index.html">light wavelength</a>.
        The first three of these relationships are shown in the graphs below.

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Light intensity (amount of light).</b> When there is no light, no photosynthesis takes place. As the
          <b>light intensity </b> (or how bright the light is) increases from zero, the rate of photosynthesis
          increases. After a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase any more with increasing
          light intensity. This happens because there is just not enough chlorophyll and other chemicals to increase
          the rate of photosynthesis any more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Carbon Dioxide concentration.</b> When there is no CO<sub>2</sub>, photosynthesis does not occur.
          Increasing the concentration of <b>Carbon Dioxide</b> will increase the rate of photosynthesis. But after
          a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase any more with increasing CO<sub>2</sub>
          concentration. So, after a certain point, more carbon dioxide in the air will no longer help plants grow.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Temperature.</b> The relationship between temperature and rate of photosynthesis
            is different from the others. Again, when the temperature is very low, no photosynthesis
            occurs. The increase in photosynthesis rate is slow at first, but starts to increase
            more quickly at a certain point. The rate of photosynthesis is highest between 10
            and 20 degrees Celsius (or 50-68 degrees F). After this maximum, the photosynthesis
            rate drops off quickly as the temperature increases. At around 40 degrees C (or 104
            degrees F), photosynthesis stops.

            <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
              <li>
                Why does photosynthesis stop at high temperatures? There are certain molecules called "enzymes" made
                by living organisms. Enzymes speed up
                <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../chemicalvs-physicalreactions/">chemical reactions</a>.
                Chlorophyll is one enzyme that helps cause photosynthesis. Another enzyme, called RuBisCo, has the job of
                capturing CO<sub>2</sub>. When the temperature is too high, RuBisCo gets very bad at capturing
                CO<sub>2</sub>. As a result, photosynthesis stops.
              </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Light wavelength.</b> Certain 
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../light/">frequencies of visible light</a> 
          speed up or slow the rate of photosynthesis. Sunlight that has energy in the blue-violet and red frequency
          ranges causes the highest rates of photosynthesis. Sunlight in the green range causes lower rates of
          photosynthesis. This is because chlorophyll pigment molecules do not absorb green light well* (and do not
          convert this radiation into energy that causes the chemical processes in photosynthesis).

          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>*This is why plants' leaves look green to us: green light is not absorbed; instead,
              it is reflected away by the molecules that make up the plants.
