    <h1>Absorption</h1>

    <div id="page1" class="page">
      <b>What is absorption?</b> You have almost certainly seen materials like paper towels and clothing (made of materials
      like cotton, wool, and denim) absorb water. Your hair also absorbs water. But other materials,
      like metals and wax-coated bird feathers, do not absorb water or other liquids. What causes certain materials to absorb liquids?<br/>

      <div style='display:block;text-align:center'><img style='display:inline;margin:5px 10px 0px 0px;float:center' src='https://sites.google.com/site/isptutorbrmstudent/_/rsrc/1560954660799/absorption/absorption_BRM.jpg'
          border='0' /> </div>
      <div><br/>
      </div>Some materials that don't absorb water are shown above. The molecules that make up these non-absorbent materials tend
      to be much closer together (or denser), not allowing H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to penetrate into the materials. 
      Even though the metal surfaces of cars don't absorb water, people often
      put a layer of wax on their cars. This wax layer prevents water from touching the metal. As a result, water on the surface of the car can't bond with the iron (Fe) of the car bodies
      to form rust (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).<br/>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div id="page2" class="page">
      <div>To understand why certain materials absorb liquids, we have to remember that water molecules have ends with opposite electric charges. 
        As shown below, the hydrogen (H) side of water molecules is positively charged and the oxygen (O) side of the molecule is negatively charged.
        Because of this, they are attracted to other water molecules and any other molecules or atoms that have areas that are charged.
        These include salt molecules (such as NaCl) and sugar molecules (such as C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>).

          towels are mostly made from trees. And guess what? Trees contain a lot of sugar molecules. (They produce sugars

      <div><br/>
      </div>
      <div>We know that sugar molecules have charged areas, which attract oppositely-charged areas of water molecules. This
        is why sugar molecules dissolve in water. Water is absorbed by paper towels through the same process of attraction
        by electric forces.</div><br>

The paper towel below absorbs water because of the electric force.</div>

<br><br>
      <div><b>Absorption by hair, wool, yarn, etc.</b>  When you take a shower, your hair gets wet because it also absorbs
        water. Your hair and similar materials like wool and yarn (which are made of animal hair, which is similar to human
        hair) are made of molecules called proteins. Like water, protein molecules also have areas that are positively and
        negatively charged. This is what allows water molecules to "stick" to hair, wool, and yarn molecules, resulting in
        absorption. </div>

    </div>

    <div id="page4" class="page">

      <div><b style='background-color:transparent'>Water temperature and absorption.</b><span style='background-color:transparent'> As
          you might expect, there is a relationship between water temperature and how much water is absorbed by a material
          (such as paper towels or hair) in a given time. As water temperature increases, the amount of water absorbed by
          a material increases.</span></div>
      <div><br/>
      </div>
      <div>Why is this? As water temperature increases, the average kinetic energy (energy due to motion) of water molecules
        increases. So, the water molecules will be able to move farther into the materials (rather than stop because they
        are "caught" by the electric force of the molecules that make up the material). So
        more water is absorbed when the water temperature is higher. <br><br> When water is cooler, the molecules on average have
        less kinetic energy. Because they're moving slower, they are more easily "caught" and stopped by the electric forces of the materials. As a result, less
        water will be absorbed by the material (Source: Songok et al., 2014).</div>

          You're right! The yarn in Glass A with the hot water will absorb more water. You will see that the part of the yarn that
          is above the water line will absorb MORE water in the hot water than in the cold water. This is because the hot
          water will move farther upward in the yarn than the cold water.

          Actually, the yarn in Glass A with the hot water will absorb more water. You will see that the part of the yarn that is above

      <div>In the scenario for Q1 above, the water absorbed by the yarn that is above the water level will evaporate into
        the air. This evaporated water will be replaced by more water from the glass that is absorbed by the yarn. This water will also evaporate. Water will continue to be absorbed and evaporate in a continuous cycle (until there's no more water).</div>
