            <h1>Absorption</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        <b>What is absorption?</b> You have almost certainly seen materials like paper towels and clothing (made
        of materials like cotton, wool, and denim) absorb water. This means that molecules of water move between
        the molecules that make up these materials and go into the materials.

        Your hair also absorbs water. This means that molecules of water move between the molecules that make up strands of your
        hair so that the water molecules are inside each strand of your hair.

       <br/><br/>But other
        materials, like metals (shown below) and wax-coated bird feathers, do not absorb water or other liquids.
      </p>

      <img alt="Water on metal" class="img-centered img-size" src="absorption_BRM.jpg"/> 

      <p>
        Why don't some materials (like the metals above) absorb liquids? The molecules that make up these non-absorbent
        materials tend to be much closer together (or denser), so H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are not able to move between the molecules of the materials to
        penetrate into the materials.

       <br/><br/>Even though the metal surfaces of cars don't absorb water, people often
        put a layer of wax on their cars. This wax layer prevents water from directly touching the metal. As a result,
        water on the surface of the car can't bond with the iron (Fe) of the car bodies to form rust
        (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>).
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">
      <p>
        <b>Electric charges also help absorption.</b> To further understand why certain materials absorb and "hold" liquids, we have to remember that water molecules have ends
        with opposite electric charges. As shown below, the hydrogen (H) side of water molecules is positively
        charged and the oxygen (O) side of the molecule is negatively charged. Because of this, they are
        attracted to other water molecules and any other molecules or atoms that have areas that are charged.
        These include salt molecules (such as NaCl) and sugar molecules (such as
        C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>).
      </p>
      <img alt="Water molecule" class="img-centered img-size" src="InkedCombinedOxygenHydrogen_A1-T1_LI2_cropped.jpg"/>

      <p class="text-centered">
        Above are two ways to represent a water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecule, which has positively and
        negatively charged sides.

      <h4>Absorption of water by different materials.</h4>

      <p>
        <b>Absorption of water by paper towels.</b>
        Water molecules also "stick" to the molecules that make up absorbent materials because of electric
        forces (see the 
        <a class="brm-link" href="../atoms-molecules/" target="_blank">Atoms: Basics</a>
        or
        <a class="brm-link" href="../electric-force/" target="_blank">electric force</a>
        unit for more information on electric forces). Paper towels are mostly made from trees. And guess what?
        Trees contain a lot of sugar molecules. (They produce sugars during
        <a class="brm-link" href="../photosynthesis/" target="_blank">photosynthesis</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that sugar molecules have charged areas, which attract oppositely-charged areas of water
        molecules. This is why sugar molecules dissolve in water. Water is absorbed by paper towels through the
        same process of attraction by electric forces.
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">
        The paper towel below absorbs water because of the electric force.
      </p>

      <img alt="paper towel absorbing water" class="img-centered img-size" src="PaperTowel_3805.jpg"/> 
     <br/>
     <br/>
      <p>
        <b>Absorption by hair, wool, yarn, etc.</b>  When you take a shower, your hair gets wet because it also
        absorbs water. Your hair and similar materials like wool and yarn (which are made of animal hair, which
        is similar to human hair) are made of molecules called proteins. Like water, protein molecules also have
        areas that are positively and negatively charged. This is what allows water molecules to "stick" to
        hair, wool, and yarn molecules, resulting in absorption. 
      </p>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page4">

      <p>
        <b>Water temperature and absorption.</b> As you might expect, there is a relationship between water
        temperature and how much water is absorbed by a material (such as paper towels or hair) in a given
        time. As water temperature increases, the amount of water absorbed by a material increases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is this? As water temperature increases, the average kinetic energy (energy due to motion) of water
        molecules increases. So, the water molecules will be able to move farther into the materials (rather
        than stop because they are "caught" by the electric force of the molecules that make up the material).
        So more water is absorbed when the water temperature is higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        When water is cooler, the molecules on average have less kinetic energy. Because they're moving slower,
        they are more easily "caught" and stopped by the electric forces of the materials. As a result, less
        water will be absorbed by the material (Source: Songok et al., 2014).

        The photo below shows salt (NaCl) growth on a plain piece of yarn after a few weeks of sitting in salt
        water. Most of the water has evaporated during this time. You may notice that most of the growth is
        toward the top of the string (the part that was just above the initial water level, represented by the blue line). This is because
        once Na+ and Cl- atoms start to build up on the yarn, they continue to attract the oppositely-charged
        atoms. Na+ atoms attract Cl- atoms and Cl- atoms attract Na+ atoms due to the electric force.

      <p>
        The <a class="brm-link" href="../electric-force/" target="_blank">electric forces</a>
        between Na+ and Cl- atoms are stronger than the electric forces of the protein molecules that make up
        the yarn. This is why the Na+ and Cl- atoms build onto each other more than they build onto the yarn to form the salt crystals you can see below.
