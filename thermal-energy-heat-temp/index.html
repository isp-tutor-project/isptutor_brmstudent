        <b>Why is thermal energy important to understand? </b>Knowing how the temperatures of objects are affected
        by factors like the temperature of the surrounding air or other objects that are touching allows us to make
        good decisions. For example, this will let us know whether it's better to open a window or turn on the
        air conditioner to cool a room. 
      </p>

        Or how we can thaw food quickly to make dinner for our families. Does frozen food thaw faster in water or
        in the air?

        <b>But what is thermal energy?</b> An object's <b>thermal energy</b> is defined as the amount of energy
        of the object due to the energy of motion — or kinetic energy — of all the atoms and/or molecules that make up
        the object.
      </p>
      <p>So....</p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          When the atoms and/or molecules that make up an object move around faster, the object has more thermal
          energy. 
        </li>
        <li>
          When the atoms and/or molecules that make up an object move around slower, the object has less thermal energy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The simulation below represents a microscopic view of a substance; the dots are its atoms. This substance is
        shown at two different times and with two different amounts of thermal energy. At Time 1, the substance is at room
        temperature. At Time 2, the substance has been cooled to a very low temperature. This is why the atoms are moving
        slower at Time 2 than Time 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thermal energy of the substance is greater at Time 1 than Time 2. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <img class="img-centered img-size_med" src="ThermalEnergyGif1031.gif"/>

 <p>
        But the temperature at Time 1 is also greater than at Time 2. So, what the heck is the difference between temperature and thermal energy?? 
      </p>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page3">
      <p>
        <b>Thermal energy vs. Temperature.</b> Thermal energy and temperature are closely related concepts. Both
        have to do with the kinetic energy of the atoms and/or molecules that make up objects or substances. But
        thermal energy and temperature are not the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the difference:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The temperature of an object (or non-solid substance, like water in a glass) is defined as the
          <i><b>average</b></i> kinetic energy of all the particles (atoms and/or molecules) that make up the
          object (or substance).
        </li>
        <li>
          The thermal energy of an object is the <b><i>total</i></b> amount of kinetic energy
          of the particles (atoms and/or molecules) that make up the object (or substance).
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>So, because thermal energy is the SUM of the kinetic energy of all the particles that make up the
              object, the thermal energy of an object depends on the SIZE of the object.
            </li>
            <li>BUT, because the temperature of an object is the AVERAGE kinetic energy of all the particles that
              make up
              the object, the temperature
              of an object does NOT depend on the size of the object.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <img class="img-centered img-size" src="MassObjects_Temp_ThermalEnergy.PNG"/> 

        <li>
          <b>Example</b>. Let's say that there are
          two objects (A and B) made of the same material and at the same temperature. This means that the particles 
          of Object A (above, left) are moving around with the same average speed as particles of Object B (above,
          right).
          But Object A has more mass, so there are more particles that make up Object A than Object B. 
          </li>
          <b>Fill-in-the-blank:</b> So, the thermal energy of Object A (or total amount of kinetic energy of its particles) is

      <p>
        <b>Thermal Energy goes from hotter to cooler objects.</b> Thermal energy is
        transferred between two objects at different temperatures that are touching each other. When two objects
        that are at different temperatures touch each other, the cooler object will become warmer and the warmer
        object will cool.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is represented in the picture below, where the higher-temperature object (red) is on the left and the
        lower-temperature object (blue) is on the right. Thermal energy will be transferred from the hotter to cooler
        object. "Heat" is the amount of thermal energy that is transferred in this process. 
      </p>

      <img alt="direction of thermal energy transfer" class="img-centered img-size_med" src="DirThermalEtransfer.PNG"/>
      <br/>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page5">
      <p>
        <b>Why does thermal energy transfer from warmer to cooler objects?</b> This happens because the particles (atoms and/or molecules)
        that make up the warmer object are moving around faster (on average) than the particles that make up the
        cooler object. When the faster-moving particles bump into the slower-moving particles, the faster-moving
        particles tend to slow down and the slower-moving particles tend to speed up.
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea is represented below, with two particles (P1 and P2): 
      </p>

      
        <img alt="Particles Transferring KE" class="img-centered img-size_500" src="ParticlesTransferringKE_final.png"/>
     
      <br/>

      <p>
        Because of this transfer of motion between the particles of objects, the warmer object will cool down and the cooler
        object will warm up. Eventually, the two objects will become the same temperature. This final temperature
        will be somewhere between the starting temperatures of the objects.

      <b>Simulation of thermal energy transfer.</b> In the simulation below, two objects that are touching each other
      are initially at different temperatures
      (represented by different colors*). The object on the left is initially at a higher temperature than the
      object on the right. Thermal energy is transferred from the higher- to the lower-temperature object until
      they reach the same final temperature (represented by purple) and will remain at that final temperature.

        *In the simulation above, the color red just represents higher temperature, where particles (atoms and/or molecules) are moving around
        with more speed and kinetic energy. The color blue just represents a lower temperature, where particles are
        moving around with less speed/kinetic energy. So just think of red as faster-moving particles and blue as
        slower-moving particles (and purple as particles moving in between these two speeds).

          That's right! If the object on the left had a higher initial temperature, its particles would be moving around

        <b>Speed of Thermal Energy Transfer.</b> How quickly thermal energy is transferred from the hotter to colder
        object depends on the temperature difference between the objects.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The greater the temperature difference is between the objects, the faster thermal energy is transferred to
          the colder object.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the difference in temperatures between the two objects gets smaller, the amount of thermal energy
          transferred in a given time decreases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This relationship is shown in the graph below (for two objects of the same material and mass). The height
        of each line (the red and blue line) shows the total amount of thermal energy transferred to the colder
        object at that time. The red line shows this for two objects that initially had a temperature difference of
        40°C. The blue line shows this for two objects that initially had a temperature difference of 80°C. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see, the amount of thermal energy transferred to the colder object is always higher when the two
        objects had a greater initial temperature difference (the blue line). Also, the speed of thermal energy
        transfer, which is the steepness (or "slope") of each line at any point in time, is always higher for the
        blue line.

      <p>
        Let's say that the cooler object needed to gain a certain amount of thermal energy (for example, to reach a
        certain temperature or to start melting). This is shown in the graph below, where the dotted line represents
        this amount of energy. The cooler object would gain this amount of thermal energy faster when there was a
        bigger initial temperature difference between the objects. You can see that the time to gain this
        energy is less for the 80°C initial difference (blue line) than for the 40°C initial difference
        (red line).

      <p>
        In general, how fast thermal energy is transferred from the hotter to colder object depends on the temperature
        difference between these objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also depends on other things like the mass of the objects and how much thermal energy it takes for the
        object's temperature to change (called the "heat capacity"). The heat capacity of an object depends on
        what the object is made of. Some materials (like metals) need less thermal energy to increase in temperature
        compared to other materials (like water). This is because the thermal energy transferred to the cooler
        object may be converted to other types of kinetic energy (such as
        <a class="brm-link" href="../kinetic-energy-temperature/index.html" target="_blank">
          rotational and vibrational</a> energies of molecules) that are not related to temperature.

        <b>Thermal energy transfer between solids and gases.</b> Thermal energy will be transferred between
        two solid objects at different temperatures. But thermal energy will also transfer between a solid and a gas
        (from whichever is warmer to whichever is cooler). For example:  
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          In the picture below, a balloon is sitting in the sun. The picture shows the cross-section of the balloon
          and the air inside the balloon. The outside surface of the balloon is warmed by the air and by the sunlight
          hitting the surface of the balloon. Some of the sunlight will be
          <a class="brm-link" href="../energy-general/index.html" target="_blank">converted into thermal energy</a>
          in the balloon. Thermal energy will transfer from the (warmer) outside surface of the balloon to the (cooler)
          inside surface of the balloon. Thermal energy will continue to be transferred from the (now warmer) inside
          material of the balloon to the (cooler) air inside the balloon. The arrows in the picture show the direction
          of transfer of thermal energy. 
        </li>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          How exactly is thermal energy transferred from the balloon material to the air inside the balloon? The
          particles that make up the material of the balloon will transfer their kinetic energy (through millions or
          billions of collisions) to gas molecules that make up the air inside the balloon. The molecules of air in
          the balloon will move around faster as a result; that is, they will gain kinetic energy.

        <li>
          Thermal energy due to the motion of the water molecules will transfer from the (warmer) water to the (colder)

          to the ice. The water molecules surrounding the ice cube will collide with the molecules that make up the ice
          cube and transfer their energy of motion to the molecules of the ice cube. Of course, as you know, this leads
          to the ice cube melting in the water. It also causes the water to cool, since the liquid water molecules lose
          kinetic energy to the molecules of the ice cube.

          Right! Heat and thermal energy are not different types of substances. They are really just related to the
          amount of motion
          of atoms/molecules.

          and an identical pot, Pot B, with 1 liter of water at 90°C. You put a jar of the sauce into each
          pot. Which jar will thaw first?</b>

        <div class="feedback-correct feedback">
          That's correct! The spaghetti sauce in the hotter water (Pot B) will thaw first. This is because thermal
          energy is transferred
          to the spaghetti sauce faster when the water is warmer. So, the sauce will gain the thermal energy needed to
          thaw it faster.

        <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
          Well, the spaghetti sauce in the hotter water (Pot B) will thaw first. This is because thermal energy is
          transferred to the
          spaghetti sauce faster when the water is warmer. So, the sauce will gain the thermal energy needed to thaw
          it faster.
