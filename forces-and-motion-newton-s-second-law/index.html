        <b>Forces and motion.</b> If we know all of the forces that are acting on an object, we can know how the object will
          move. This is how NASA scientists are able to predict the motion of planets, comets, and
          other astronomical bodies.  
      </p>
      <p class="text-justified">
        Closer to home, here on Earth, we can also predict the motion of everyday objects if we know all of the forces
        acting on the objects. For example, we can predict the motion of a shopping cart someone is pushing through a
        supermarket or the motion of a ball rolling down a hill.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <div style="display:block;text-align:left">

      </div>

      <p>
        We can figure out the motion of objects using the equations of<b>Newton's Second Law.</b> Newton's Second law
        is sometimes expressed as: Force equals mass times acceleration (or <b>F</b> = <b>ma</b>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a <u>very</u> simple way of saying what Newton's second Law really means: <b><i>The sum of all
        the forces that are acting on an object (or the "net force" on an object) in a given direction is equal
        to the mass of the object times the acceleration of the object in that direction.</i></b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          One important thing to realize is that only forces that are external to the object and act
          on the object affect the object's acceleration. This is why you can't, for example, pull
          yourself up off the ground: your pulling on yourself is an internal force. You would need
          someone or something else pulling on you to actually lift you up off of the ground!
        </li>
      </ul>


    </div>

    <div id="page2" class="page">

      <p>
        <b>Question for you:</b> Does an object's acceleration cause forces to act on the object ((OR)) do forces
        acting on the object cause an object's acceleration? (Think about this for a few seconds...)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you said the forces acting <i>on</i> an object determine the object's acceleration, then you were right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because an object's acceleration is caused by forces acting on it, it actually makes much more sense to
        write <b>Newton's second law</b> as: 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The <b>acceleration</b> of an object in a given direction is equal to the <b>sum of all forces</b> 
          ("net" force) acting on the object in that direction divided by the mass of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Or: <b>a </b> = <b>F<sub>net</sub></b> / m.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-centered">
        This relationship is shown in the figure below.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img class="img-centered" src="GraphNewBRMColor.jpg"
           alt="graph_showing_relationship_between_net_force_and_acceleration" />
      <br/>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The acceleration of an object is also determined by its mass (see 
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank"  href="../mass/index.html">Mass</a>
          unit). The more mass an object has, the more it will resist changing its motion.
          In other words, the more mass an object has, the less it will accelerate.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>So, we can figure out the acceleration of an object in a direction if we know (a) its mass and (b) the
          sum of all of the forces that are acting on the object in that direction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This is a little hard to understand (it's a bit complicated!). Let's see what this means. We will give
          examples of applying Newton's Second Law, starting with the simplest scenarios.</b>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="page3" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>Acceleration when no forces act on object.</b> Here on Earth, because gravitational forces affect all
        objects, we don't come across cases where no forces act on objects. We need to go to space for that...
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><b>Example.</b> A meteor is in outer space. No forces are acting on the meteor.
          What is its acceleration?</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that the sum of all forces acting on the meteor is equal to 0 N. ("N" stands for
        "Newtons," which is a unit of force. It is named after the famous physicist
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../isaacnewton/index.html">Isaac Newton</a>,
        whose second law of motion we are applying here! One Newton is equal to 1 kg*m/s<sup>2</sup>.
        In other words, one Newton (N) is equal to the amount of force needed to accelerate a 1 kg
        object at 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We will apply Newton's Second Law:
      </p>
      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>a</b> = <b>F</b><b><sub>net</sub></b> / m
        </li>
        <li>
          The acceleration of the meteor =  the sum of all forces acting on the meteor / mass of the meteor.
        </li>
        <li>
          The acceleration of meteor = 0 / mass of the meteor.
        </li>
        <li>
          So, the acceleration of the meteor is equal to zero. (It doesn't change its motion.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And because there are no forces acting in any direction, the acceleration of the meteor is zero in all
        directions. That is, the meteor does not accelerate in <i>any</i> direction.
      </p>

        <b>Acceleration when one force acts on an object.</b> Now, let's say there is only <b>one force</b> acting
        on an object in a given direction. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Example 1:</b> <i>Two astronauts are in a space shuttle in outer space, where there is no gravity. The
          astronauts are hungry, so one gets a candy bar from storage and pushes it to the other astronaut with a
          force of 0.1 N (one-tenth of a Newton). </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This means that the sum of all forces acting the object (candy bar) would be 0.1 N.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The candy bar has a mass of 0.1 kg. What is the acceleration of the candy bar while the astronaut
          is pushing it?</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        We will apply Newton's Second Law here:
      </p>
      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>a</b> = <b>F</b><b><sub>net</sub></b> / m
        </li>
        <li>
          The acceleration of the candy bar = the sum of all forces acting on the candy bar in
          given direction / mass of the candy bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          The acceleration of the candy bar = 0.1 N (in the direction of the push) / 0.1 kg.
        </li>
        <li>
          Acceleration = 1 N/kg = 1 m/s<sup>2  </sup>(Since 1 Newton is equal to 1 kg*m/s<sup>2</sup>)
                in the direction of the push.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It's important to understand that when the astronaut stops pushing on the candy bar, its acceleration
        becomes zero. This is because there are no forces acting on the candy bar.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p>
        <b>Example 2:</b> <i>A 10 kg block of ice is sitting on a flat horizontal surface. As shown below, someone
          pushes horizontally on the block in the +x-direction (to the right) with a force of 2 N. </i>
      </p>

      <a href="../forces-and-motion-newton-s-second-law/IceBlockHorizSurface.GIF?attredirects=0/index.html">

      <p>
        <i>What is the horizontal acceleration of th ice block while it is being pushed? (Assume that there is
          no friction between the ice block and surface.)</i>
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p>
        To answer this question, we will apply <b>Newton's second law</b>: The <b>acceleration</b> of an object
        in the horizontal direction is equal to the <b>sum of all forces</b> ("net" force) acting on the object
        in the horizontal direction divided by the mass of the object (or <b>a = F</b>/ m).
      </p>
      <p>
        Only one force acts on the ice block in the horizontal direction: the +2 N pushing force. 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>a</b> = <b>F</b><b><sub>net</sub></b> / m
        </li>
        <li>
          Acceleration of the block = +2 N / 10 kg
        </li>
        <li>
          Acceleration of block = +0.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        (But right when the push ends, the acceleration of the ice block will be zero.)
      </p>

    <div id="page6" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>Acceleration when <u>more than one force</u> acts on an object.</b> Things get a bit more
        complicated when there is <b>more than one force</b> acting on an object in a particular direction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, <b>Newton's Second Law</b> says that the acceleration of an object in a particular direction is equal
        to the sum of all forces acting on the object (the "net force") in that direction divided by the acceleration
        of the object in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is more than one force acting on an object, we need to calculate the "net" force.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Calculating the Net force</b>. The “net” force in a given direction is the sum of all forces acting
        in that direction <u>minus</u> the sum of all forces acting in the <i>opposite</i> direction.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <p>
        <b>Example 1: </b>In the picture below, a 1 kg book is sitting on a desk. There are two forces on the
        book in the vertical (up/down) direction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We will calculate the <b>Net force</b> in the downward vertical direction: 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          This is equal to the force of gravity pulling down on the book MINUS the force of the
          table pushing upward on the book. These two forces are equal. Therefore, the Net force
          in the downward vertical direction is equal to zero.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <a href="../forces-and-motion-newton-s-second-law/BookOnDesk.GIF?attredirects=0/index.html">
        <img class="img-centered" src="BookOnDesk.GIF" alt="image of book on desk" width="400" height="320" />
      </a>
      <br/>

      <p>
        We now know the net force force acting on the book in the vertical direction (0 N). We also know the
        mass of the book (1 kg).
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          So, we can calculate the book's acceleration in the vertical direction using Newton's
          second law (<b>a</b> = <b>F</b><b><sub>net</sub></b>/m):
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>a</b> = 0 / 1 kg = 0
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        So, the book's acceleration is equal to zero. It does not change its motion. It just sits there.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Example 2.</b> In a game of tug-of-war,
          there are two forces acting on the rope (with a red flag in the middle) in the horizontal
          direction. (See picture below.) If the two teams pull equally hard on the rope but
          in the opposite directions (one team pulls horizontally to the right and the other
          team pulls horizontally to the left), the rope will not move; neither will the people
          pulling. 
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="tugofwarRevised.jpg" />

      <p>
        <b>Example 3.</b> Now, let's say that someone on the team on the right lost their grip on the rope for just
        a moment. As a results, the rope starts moving (or accelerates) to the left. After the recovery and the
        person regains their grip, both teams are again pulling in opposite directions with the same force. Because
        the net force acting on the rope is once again zero, the rope does not accelerate: the rope does not speed
        up or slow down. Instead, it keeps moving to the left at that same speed. Soon, the team on the left wins
        the contest!
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p>
        In these examples, the net force acting on the object in the given direction was zero. So, the acceleration
        of the object was also zero in that direction. (Remember: constant speed--without changing direction--is
        also zero acceleration!)

            Actually...The (poor) mom will accelerate at +0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This was calculated from Newton's Second Law: a = F<sub>net</sub>/m = +30N/60kg = +0.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.

        <b>Example 5:</b> <i>Now, let's say we have a 10 kg object, which is acted on by four forces as described
          below. What is the acceleration of the object?</i>

      <p>
        We can find the acceleration of the body by applying Newton's Second Law: 
        <b>a</b> = <b>F</b><b><sub>net</sub></b> / m
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          a = -2 N / 10 kg = -0.2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  The negative sign means that
          the acceleration is in the negative x-direction (or to the left).
        </li>

        <b>Net force causes acceleration.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If the Net force acting on an object in a given direction is NOT equal to zero, the object will
          accelerate in the direction of the net force. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          If there is only one force acting on the object in that direction, the object will accelerate in
          that direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are two unbalanced forces acting on the object in that direction, the object will accelerate
          in that direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, if the sum of all forces acting on the object in one direction is not equal to the sum of
          forces acting on it in the opposite direction, the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        How fast the object accelerates depends on the <i>magnitude</i> (value or amount) of the net force. As the
        magnitude of net force increases, the magnitude of the acceleration will also increase.

        The <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../mass/">mass</a>
        of the object also affects how much the object accelerates when a net force acts on the object. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As you probably think, the more mass an object has, the less the object will accelerate when the same net
        force acts on it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And the <i>less </i>mass an object has, the <i>more</i> it will accelerate when that same net force acts
        on the object.

      <p>
        This relationship between mass and acceleration is shown below.

      <p>
        In summary, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../proportional-1/"> inversely proportional to</a>
        its mass. These relationships are summarized in <b>Newton's Second Law</b>: The acceleration of an object
        [in a given direction] is equal to the net force acting on the object in that direction divided by the mass of
        the object:
