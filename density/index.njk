<div class="page" id="page1">

      <p>
        <b>Density.</b> When density of an object is how much mass is in a certain amount of space. The density of an
        object is equal to its mass divided by its volume. This relationship is shown below:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Density = mass/Volume   or   D = m/V</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-centered">
        There is more mass in the same space for the object on the left below. So, the object on the left has a
        higher density.

      <p>
        <b>Mass:</b> The mass of an object is how much material (or "stuff") it is made of. An object's mass is
        basically the sum total of all of the atoms and molecules that make up the object. It also depends on what
        types of atoms make up the object. 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          For example, an object that is made up of 10<sup>6</sup> (one million) atoms of carbon has less mass than an
          object made up of 10<sup>6</sup> (one million) atoms of iron. This is because each atom of iron has more mass
          than each atom of carbon (the mass is mostly in the center, or nucleus, of atoms).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        (See the
        <a class="brm-link" href="../mass/" target="_blank">mass</a> 
        unit for more information about mass.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Volume:</b> The volume of an object is amount of space taken up by the object.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>An atom is very, very small, and has a very small volume.</li>
        <li>At the other extreme, a planet (like Earth) is very, very large, and has a large volume.</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>

      <p>
        <b>Back to Density.</b> The density of an object is the amount of material it is made of divided by the space
        it occupies: mass of object / volume of object. The densities of some common materials are shown below.

            You are right! If you add salt to water, the density of the (now) salt water will increase.
            This happens because the mass of the salt and water increases, but volume of the water when salt is added does not change.
        </div>
        <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
            Actually, if you add salt to water, the density of the (now) salt water will increase.
            This happens because the mass of the salt and water increases, but volume of the water when salt is added does not change.

        <b>Density and state of matter.</b> For the same type of substance, the density of the substance is in general
        greatest when the substance is in solid form. The density of a substance is less dense in its liquid state.
        And, you guessed it, the density of the substance is lowest when the substance is in gas form. The relationship
        between density and states of matter is shown in the picture below:
