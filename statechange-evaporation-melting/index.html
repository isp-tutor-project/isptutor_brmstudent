            you are heating a pot of water on the stove (shown below). 
            
            Thermal energy is produced in the chemical reaction of burning natural gas (which is mostly methane). This reaction produces high-energy (or very fast-moving!) CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

            These molecules hit the metal molecules that make up the pot. As a result, the molecules of the pot start vibrating faster. Thermal energy is then transferred between the pot's molecules and from the pot's molecules </span><span

            If water is at a higher temperature, the molecules that make up the water are moving around faster. So, they have more energy
            to break their bonds with other H<sub>2</sub>O molecules and escape into the air (or evaporate). This is why water evaporates
            faster at a higher temperature.

        <b> Analogies for Evaporation.</b> Evaporation is similar to a rocket blasting off and escaping from the Earth's
        gravitational field. Rockets need to have enough speed to overcome the pull of gravity and escape from the Earth's
        atmosphere. To escape into the air (or evaporate), water molecules need to have enough speed to overcome the electric
        forces of other H<sub>2</sub>O molecules within the liquid water and especially at the surface of the
        water (where H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are even more strongly bonded together).
        <br><br>

        <div style='text-align:center'><img src='spaceshuttletakingoff.jpg'></div><br><br>

        <div>Another analogy for evaporation is rolling a magnetic steel ball on a table past a magnet. If you roll the ball
          slowly, the ball will get "caught" in the magnetic field and "stick" to the magnet. But if you roll the ball faster,
          it will have enough speed to overcome the magnetic attraction and move past the magnet. This is why H<sub>2</sub>O molecules that are moving around faster are more likely to evaporate. They can "escape"
          from the electric forces of the other H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

        <div><b>Evaporation of salt water.</b> In the <a target='_blank' href='../dissolving/index.html'><b><font color='#0000ff'>unit
                on dissolving</font></b></a>, we talked about how salt (and also sugar) dissolve in water. But what happens
          when salt water evaporates? Let's say we have a glass of salt water sitting on a window sill. We forget about it
          and discover it several weeks later. What will we find? 
          
          <br><br>Most likely, most (if not all) of the water will have evaporated. This happens because eventually, individual water molecules will gain enough kinetic energy (from the sun or surrounding air) to evaporate. But the originally dissolved
          salt (NaCl) will <u>not</u> evaporate with the water molecules. Why not?</div>
        <div><br/>
        </div>
        <div>One reason that the NaCl molecules will not evaporate even though H<sub>2</sub>O molecules do is because they are much heavier than H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. If we look at the <a target='_blank' href='../periodic-table/index.html'><b><font
                color='#0000ff'>Periodic Table of Elements</font></b></a>, we see that the atomic mass of Na is 23 "atomic
          mass units" or amu. And Cl is about 35 amu. </div>
        <br>
        <div><li>So, one molecules of NaCl is 23 amu + 35 amu = 58 amu.</li></div>
        <br>
        <div>In H<sub>2</sub>O, there are two H atoms. Each H atom is only 1 amu. There is one O atom, which is 16 amu.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div><li>So, one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is only 18 amu.</li>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>Because NaCl molecules are heavier, they are pulled downward by the Earth's gravity more strongly than H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. So, they do not escape from the glass and evaporate into the air. Below is
          a photo of the inside of a glass that had water with salt dissolved in it. This photo was taken after all the water
          evaporated (about three weeks later). The salt had formed hard crystals along the inside of the glass as the water
          evaporated.
