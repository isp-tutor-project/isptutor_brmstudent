    <h1>State Change: Evaporation and Melting</h1>

    <div id="page1" class="page">

      <p>
        <b>What is Evaporation?</b> Say you are heating a pot of water on the stove (shown below).

        Thermal energy is produced in the chemical reaction of burning natural gas (which is mostly methane). This
        reaction produces high-energy (or very fast-moving!) CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

        These molecules hit the metal molecules that make up the pot. As a result, the molecules of the pot start
        vibrating faster. Thermal energy is then transferred between the pot's molecules and from the pot's molecules 
        to nearby water molecules. This causes the water molecules to move around faster and faster. The water's
        temperature is increasing.
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="pot-883036_1920.jpg" alt="pot of water" />
     <br/>

      <p>
        Soon, some water molecules move fast enough to overcome the pull from
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../electric-force/">electric forces</a>
        of other water molecules around them. They also have to overcome the electric forces of the water molecules
        at the surface. When they are moving fast enough, the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules leave the pot and move into the air.
        These H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are now



          <select id="FIB1" class="fib_select" onchange="fibUpdate('FIB1')">
          <option value="#ffffff" selected disabled>(Select one)</option>
            <option value="#ed8587">in a solid state</option>

            <option value="#11bf7a">in a gas state</option>
          </select>

        called water vapor. This process of going from a liquid to gas state is what we know as <b>evaporation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a liquid like water evaporates, the molecules themselves do not change when they move from the pot into
        the air. They are still H<sub>2</sub>O molecules (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom). Because the
        molecules don't change, this is a

      <p>
        <b>Analogies for Evaporation.</b> Evaporation is similar to a rocket blasting off and escaping from the
        Earth's gravitational field. Rockets need to have enough speed to overcome the pull of gravity and escape
        from the Earth's atmosphere. To escape into the air (or evaporate), water molecules need to have enough
        speed to overcome the electric forces of other H<sub>2</sub>O molecules within the liquid water and
        especially at the surface of the water (where H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are even more strongly bonded
        together).
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="spaceshuttletakingoff.jpg" alt="space shuttle taking off" />
     <br/>

      <p>
        Another analogy for evaporation is rolling a magnetic steel ball on a table past a magnet. If you roll the
        ball slowly, the ball will get "caught" in the magnetic field and "stick" to the magnet. But if you roll the
        ball faster, it will have enough speed to overcome the magnetic attraction and move past the magnet. This is
        why faster-moving H<sub>2</sub>O molecules are more likely to evaporate. They can "escape"
        from the electric forces of the other H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

        <b>Evaporation of salt water.</b> In the
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../dissolving/">unit on dissolving</a>,
        we talked about how salt (and also sugar) dissolve in water. But what happens when salt water evaporates?
        Let's say we have a glass of salt water sitting on a window sill. We forget about it and discover it several
        weeks later. What will we find?
      </p>
      <p>
        Most likely, most (if not all) of the water will have evaporated. This happens because eventually,
        individual water molecules will gain enough kinetic energy (from the sun or surrounding air) to evaporate.
        But the originally dissolved salt (NaCl) will <u>not</u> evaporate with the water molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a photo of the inside of a glass that had water with salt dissolved in it. This photo was taken after
        all the water evaporated (about three weeks later). The salt had formed hard crystals along the inside of the
        glass as the water evaporated.
      </p>

      <a href="../statechange-evaporation-melting/RemainingSaltInGlass.jpg?attredirects=0/index.html">
        <img class="img-centered" src="RemainingSaltInGlass.jpg"  width="320" height="240"
             alt="glass showing remaining salt" />
      </a>
     <br/>

      <p>
        <b>Why does the salt stay behind?</b> One reason that the NaCl molecules will not evaporate even though
        H<sub>2</sub>O molecules do is because they are much heavier than H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. If we look at the
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../periodic-table/">Periodic Table of Elements</a>, we see that the
        atomic mass of Na is 23 "atomic mass units" or amu. And Cl is about 35 amu. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>So, one molecules of NaCl is 23 amu + 35 amu = 58 amu.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        In H<sub>2</sub>O, there are two H atoms. Each H atom is only 1 amu. There is one O atom, which is 16 amu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>So, one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is only 18 amu.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because NaCl molecules are heavier, they are pulled downward by the Earth's gravity more strongly than
        H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. So, they do not escape from the glass and evaporate into the air.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="page5" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>What is Melting?</b> When thermal energy is transferred to ice, the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules
        begin to vibrate faster and faster. Some of the molecules have enough energy to overcome their bonds with
        nearby H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. These molecules are no longer fixed in place in the ice crystal (see
        Crystals unit) and can freely move about. These molecules are now in liquid form. If enough thermal energy
        is transferred to the ice, the ice will melt completely and become liquid water. In its liquid state, the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules
        are now moving around independently, kind of "slithering" past each other. But there are still attractions
        between H<sub>2</sub>O molecules because of electric forces (see the
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../atoms-molecules/">Atoms Unit</a>
        for more information).

      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          When H<sub>2</sub>O changes from solid to liquid to gas is that the individual H<sub>2</sub>O molecules stay
          together. They do NOT break up into individual atoms. This idea is true for <b>any</b> type of molecule
          that changes state: the molecule stays the same!
        </li>
        <li>
          Another important point is that <b>each individual molecule stays the same size during state change</b>.
          The molecules themselves do not get bigger or smaller; they just move around more or less.
          (<span style="color:#ff0000">Some people mistakenly think that molecules themselves get bigger or smaller
