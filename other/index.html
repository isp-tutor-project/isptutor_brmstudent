         <span style='background-color:transparent'><b>What is nucleation?</b> Have you ever noticed that
            when you first fill a pot with water, you often see bubbles on the inside surface of the pot? These bubbles are air that
            was mixed in with the water when you filled the pot.</span>
        <p>Or, if you put your finger in a glass of soda or any carbonated drink, you will see bubbles form on your finger. These
          bubbles are made of the carbon dioxide in the carbonated soda.</p>
        <p>Both of these examples involve the process of <i><b>nucleation</b></i>. Nucleation is a process where the same type of
          molecules build up <span style='background-color:transparent'>(such as a bunch of CO</span><sub>2</sub><span style='background-color:transparent'> molecules or a bunch of NaCl 
            molecules or a bunch of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules)</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>. Molecules build up on what are
            called “nucleation sites.” Nucleation sites include places on surfaces that are not smooth, but rather have bumps and/or
            holes. Your finger is not completely smooth, but has little bumps, including what we call fingerprints. This is why you
            will see bubbles form on your finger if you put it in a carbonated drink. </span></p>

        <p><b><br/></b></p>
        <p>Bubbles will form on your finger when you put it in a carbonated liquid (a liquid with dissolved carbon dioxide). This
          is because there are little bumps and ridges on your finger where the bubbles of carbon dioxide will build up.</p>
        <p>Notice that there are few bubbles on the inside of the glass. This is because glass is much smoother than your finger,
          so there are not as many little bumps and ridges where carbon dioxide bubbles can build up.</p>

          <p><b>Bumpy surfaces cause nucleation.</b> Say you found a pot that had a very smooth surface. You wouldn’t see nearly as
            many air bubbles form on the inside surface of that pot when you pour water into it. This is because there are fewer nucleation
            sites on a very smooth surface compared to a rougher surface.</p>
          <p>Nucleation sites also help water molecules build up to freeze into ice! In addition to rough spots on surfaces, impurities
            in water such as dirt particles or salt can also become nucleation sites. Ice begins to form around nucleation sites. <span
              style='background-color:transparent'>In fact, when there are no nucleation sites, water freezes (or becomes ice) at a MUCH
              lower temperature: approximately -39°C (or -38</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>°F)</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>!  </span><span
              style='background-color:transparent'>(Water normally freezes into ice at about 0</span><span style='background-color:transparent'>°C

              style='background-color:transparent'>In other words, if water is in a very smooth container, and the water does not have
              any impurities in it (the liquid is only made of H</span><sub>2</sub><span style='background-color:transparent'>O molecules), it will become ice at a much lower temperature. </span><span style='background-color:transparent'>But
              most people never encounter water that is 100% pure. Even distilled water has a small amount of impurities in it (though
              much less than tap water).</span></p>

                            You're right! More soda would "explode" from Bottle A than Bottle B. 
                            Because there are more scratches on Bottle A, there are more nucleation sites (places for CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles to form). 
                            So, there would be more CO<sub>2</sub> escaping from the soda.
