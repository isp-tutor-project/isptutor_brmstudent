        <b>What is Surface Area?</b> The surface area of an object is defined as the total area of the <i>surface</i> of the
        3-dimensional object. The surface is the outermost region of an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this unit, we will calculate surface area of various shapes with <i>smooth surfaces</i>.

        <b>Surface Area of Cubes</b>
      </p>


          <b>Example of calculating surface area of sphere:</b> As shown below, the diameter of a cube is 3 cm.
         <br/><br/>So, each of the faces (sides) of the cube has an area of 3 x 3, or 9
          cm<sup>2</sup>. 

          A cube has

          <select class="fib_select" id="FIB1" onchange="fibUpdate('FIB1')">
            <option disabled="" selected="" value="#ffffff">(Select one)</option>
            <option value="#ed8587">2 sides.</option>
            <option value="#ed8587">4 sides.</option>
            <option value="#11bf7a">6 sides.</option>
            <option value="#ed8587">8 sides.</option>
          </select>

         <br/><br/>So, the total surface area of the cube would be 6 x 9 cm<sup>2</sup>, or 54 cm<sup>2</sup>.

      <p>
        In general, the <b>surface area of a cube</b> of diameter, d, is equal to:
          d<sup>2</sup> (area per side) × 6 (sides) = <b>6d<sup>2</sup></b>
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">

      <b>Surface Area of Spheres</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the <b>surface area of a sphere</b> of radius, r, is equal to <b>4</b>
      <span class="text-md font-times">π</span><b>r<sup>2</sup></b>. 

     <br/><br/>

       In this equation, 
      <span class="text-md font-times">π</span> is "pi", which is 3.1415..., or about 3.
    </p>

    <p>
        The radius of a circle is equal to half of its diameter: r = d/2.

       <br/><br/>

        We can substitute "d/2" for "r" in the
        formula above:

        </p><ul><li>
        4<span class="font-times text-md">π</span>(d/2)<sup>2</sup> = 4<span class="font-times text-md">π</span>d<sup>2</sup>/4 = 
        <span class="font-times text-md">π</span>d<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        So...

        <b>Example of calculating surface area of sphere:</b> A sphere has a diameter of 4 cm. We can calculate the

          Right! In general, if a cube and sphere have the same diameter, the cube has greater surface area.
          This is because the surface area of a sphere is pi (about 3) times the diameter squared. And the surface area of a cube is 6 times
          the cube's diameter squared.
          So, for any cube and sphere of the same diameter, the surface area of the cube will be almost *twice* that of the

        <b>Surface area (for non-smooth surfaces)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we calculated the surface area of the objects above, we assumed that the surfaces were completely smooth.
        But if the surfaces were bumpy instead of smooth, their surface areas would be larger. For example, a golf
        ball, which has dimples on its surface, has more surface area than a smooth ball of the same (average) radius.

        <b>Surface area to volume ratio for sphere</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, as the diameter of a sphere increases, the ratio of its surface area to its volume decreases.
        That is, as the diameter of a sphere increases, the sphere will have LESS surface area per given volume of
        space. <b>Or</b>, as the diameter of a sphere increases, the sphere will have MORE volume per surface area.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Surface area of sphere: 
          <b style="color:rgb(103,78,167)">
            <span class="text-md font-times">π</span>d<sup>2</sup>
