      <b><i>Spheres</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the <b>surface area of a sphere</b> of radius, r, is equal to <b class="text-lg">4</b>
      <span class="text-xl font-times">π</span>
      <b class="text-lg">r<sup>2</sup></b>.  In this equation,

        Example 2: a sphere has a radius of 2 cm. We can calculate the surface area of the sphere, 
        <span class="text-lg">
          which is the area of the outer part of the sphere (that we can touch/feel) by using this formula:
        </span>
        <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
          <li>
            Surface area (of a sphere) = 4

      </li>
      <li>
        Example 2b: if the sphere were smaller, and only had a radius of 1 cm, as you probably suspect, the
        surface area of the sphere would also be smaller. We can prove this mathematically:
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The radius of a circle is equal to half of its diameter: r = d/2. We can substitute "d/2" for "r" in the
        formula above: 4
        <span class="font-times text-xl">π</span>
        <span class="text-lg">(d/2)</span>
        <sup>2</sup> = 4
        <span class="font-times text-xl">π</span>
        <span class="text-lg">d<sup>2</sup>/4 = </span>
        <span class="font-times text-xl">π</span>
        <span class="text-lg">d</span>
        <sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the <b>surface area of a sphere</b> that has a diameter,d, is equal to 
        <b class="font-times text-xl">π</b>
        <b><span class="text-lg">d</span><sup>2</sup></b>.
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">

          Right! In general, if a cube and sphere have the same diameter, the cube has greater surface area.
          This is because the SA of a sphere is pi (about 3) times the diameter squared. And the SA of a cube is 6 times
          the cube's diameter squared.
          So, for any cube and sphere of the same diameter, the SA of the cube will be almost *twice* that of the
          sphere!

        <b><i>Surface area (for non-smooth surfaces)</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we calculated the surface area of the objects above, we assumed that the surfaces were completely smooth.
        But if the surfaces were bumpy instead of smooth, their surface areas would be larger. For example, a golf
        ball, which has dimples on its surface, has more surface area than a smooth ball of the same (average) radius.
