            <h1>Speed, Velocity &amp; Acceleration</h1>

<div class="page" id="page1">
      <p>
        <b>Speed, velocity, and acceleration are related to each other.</b> Each of these can
        be measured at an instant (or a point in time) or as averages over a given time interval
        (for example, a few seconds or minutes). We'll start with the simplest of these quantities, speed...
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>First, what is speed?</b> The <b>Speed of an object</b> is simply how fast the object is moving. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can calculate (a) the speed of an object
        across some time, or the <b>average speed</b>, or (b) the speed of an object at a moment
        in time: the <b>"instantaneous" speed</b>.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">
      <p>
        <b>Average speed.</b> <i><b>The average</b></i> speed of an object is defined as the distance the object
        travels divided by the time it takes to travel that distance:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Speed (average) = distance traveled / time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, a car drives a distance of 10,000 meters (6.21 miles) in 1,000 seconds
        (16.67 minutes). The car's average speed can be calculated as:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Speed (average) = 10,000 m / 1,000 s = 10 m/s</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We can also calculate the time it takes something to move a certain distance, if we know the distance it
        travels and its average speed during that time:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>time = distance / speed (average)</li>
      </ul>

            For example, a lost dog runs a distance of 3,000 meters looking for his home. His path is shown in the
            picture above. The dog's high-tech collar shows that his average speed during this time was 3 m/s.
            The (happy) owner calculated the time the dog took to find his home using this equation:
          </p>

          <ul class="brm-list">
            <li>time = distance / average speed </li>
            <li>time = 3,000 m / 3 m/s </li>
            <li>time= 1,000 s </li>
            <li>time = 1,000 s / (60 s / 1 minute)</li>
            <li>time = 16.67 minutes </li>

        <b>To simplify, in this unit, the following definitions of velocity and acceleration will apply to
          <i>motion in a straight line without changing direction</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is Velocity?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The velocity of an object includes both its speed <i>and</i> the direction it is moving. Because it has
        both a numerical value and a direction, velocity is said to be a "vector" quantity. (See 
        <a class="brm-link" href="../vectors/" target="_blank">Vector vs. Scalar Quantities</a>
        for more information about vectors.) 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          If the speed of an object is 100 m/s and the object is moving eastward, its velocity is 100 m/s eastward.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The <b><i>instantaneous</i></b> velocity of an object is its speed (for example, meters per second)
        <b>and</b> direction it is moving <i>at a specific moment in time</i>. The instantaneous speed in
        combination with the direction the object is moving at a given time is equal to its instantaneous
        velocity (at that point in time).
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Instantaneous Velocity = Instantaneous Speed + direction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The picture below shows a speedometer (in kilometers per hour, or km/h). The car is moving due east at the
        moment this picture was taken. So, we would say that the instantaneous velocity of the car at this moment
        is 245 km/h due east.

<div class="page" id="page5">
      <p>
        <b>What is acceleration?</b> An object is <b>accelerating</b> if its <b>velocity</b> is changing.
        Remember: velocity is a
        <a class="brm-link" href="../vectors/" target="_blank">vector quantity</a>,
        which means it has both a magnitude (speed) and a direction (the direction it is moving).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, an object is accelerating if either its SPEED is changing or if the DIRECTION the object is moving
        changes. Or both!
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For example, if an object is moving in a straight line but its speed is
          changing, this object is accelerating (or its acceleration is not equal to
          zero). For example, the car below is accelerating. Its speed increases with each
          second. (You can tell because it moves farther and farther with each second.) 
        </li>
      </ul>


      <img alt="car accelerating over 4 seconds" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="CarAccelerating.GIF"/>


      <ul>
        <li>If an object is moving at the same speed but changing directions, the object
          is accelerating. For example, the car below is moving on a circular track at a
          constant speed (moving the same distance every 10 seconds). But it is constantly
          changing directions. Because it is changing directions, it is accelerating (or
          its acceleration is not equal to zero). 
        </li>
      </ul>


      <img class="img-centered img-size_med" src="CarInCircle.GIF"/>

      <br/>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If an object is changing in speed <i>and</i> direction, it is
          accelerating. In the example below, the speed of the car is increasing from
          0 seconds to 30 seconds. The car is also (constantly) changing its
          direction. So, this car is accelerating — and its acceleration is
          <i>greater</i> than the acceleration of the car above that changes direction
          without changing speed.

        <b>Acceleration (average). </b>Just like speed and velocity, we can calculate either
        average acceleration (over some time) or the instantaneous acceleration (at a moment in
        time).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b><i>average</i></b> acceleration of an object is defined as the change in velocity of an
        object divided by the time it took for the velocity to change:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Acceleration (average) = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time (with direction)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <i>If an object is moving in a straight line in a given direction</i>, the magnitude
        of the acceleration of the object is equal to the change in its speed over the time it
        takes for that change in speed as well of the direction of its change in speed:
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>Acceleration (average) = (final speed - initial speed) / time (with direction)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In general, when something is moving in a straight line and its speed is increasing, its acceleration
        is in the <i>same</i> direction of its motion or velocity.

        <i><b>Example 1: Speeding up/Accelerating</b>: A car initially at a
          stop light accelerates in a straight line eastward and reaches a speed of 20 m/s (about 45
          miles per hour) in 10 seconds. </i>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <br/>
      The car's acceleration can be calculated as:
      <ul>
        <li>Acceleration (average) = (20 m/s - 0) / 10 s = 2 m/s<sup>2 </sup> (eastward)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This means that each second, the speed of the car increases by 2 m/s. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So after one second, the car is travelling at 2 m/s. After two seconds, the car is travelling at 4 m/s.
        After three seconds, the car is travelling at 6 m/s, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This relationship between time and speed for a car accelerating at a constant 2 m/s<sup>2</sup> is

      <p>Reversing the sides of the equation:</p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          Final velocity = acceleration × time (for object to go from the initial to final velocity) + initial velocity

      <p> Solving for final velocity:</p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li> Final velocity = 2 m/s<sup>2</sup> × 2 s + 0 m/s  = 4 m/s</li>

          The box accelerates from rest at 4 m/s<sup>2</sup> for 2 seconds. This means that the speed of the box
          increases by 4 m/s every second. So, after one second, the box would be moving at 4 m/s.
          After 2 seconds, the box would be moving at 8 m/s.<br/>
          You could also use the equation:<br/>
          V<sub>f</sub> = V<sub>i</sub> + a*t<br/>
          V<sub>f</sub> = 0 + 4*2 = 8 m/s
