        <b>One Type of Vascular Plants: Plants with Seeds.</b> Vascular plants can be divided into two groups: plants that make seeds
        (spermatophytes: "sperm" means "seeds") and plants that do not. We’ll talk about plants that produce seeds here.
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="PlantCategoriesseedbearing.png" alt="Seed-bearing Plant Categories" />

      
        Seed plants can be divided into whether they have flowers or not. <b>Angiosperms</b> are
        plants that have flowers. <b>Gymnosperms</b> are plants that do not have flowers. First, we'll talk about angiosperms.
      

    </div>

    <div id="page2" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>Angiosperms</b> (from Greek: angio means “vessel” and sperm means “seed”) are seed plants that
        produce flowers.

      </p>
      <p>
        The seeds of these plants are sometimes enclosed in a fruit
        (e.g., in apples, oranges, peaches). Fruits are the “vessels” that hold the seeds that developed from the
        plant's ovary. Sunflowers are one type of angiosperm. Unlike most other angiosperms, though, sunflower
        seeds are not enclosed in an edible fruit, but instead, the seeds are enclosed in hardened inedible material
        (which is, biologically speaking, considered a "fruit" because it developed from the surrounding ovary).

          Unlike most angiosperms, the seeds in gymnosperms are “naked,” or are not surrounded by fruit (because,
          unlike angiosperms, they were not formed in an ovary). Their seeds are wedged between the woody “scales”
          of the cones. The picture below shows seeds (top right) from pine cones.

        <b>Parts of Seeds</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A seed is an embryonic (baby) plant inside a protective outer covering (or a shell). The formation of
        the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants (spermatophytes), including the gymnosperm
        and angiosperm plants. The seeds of plants look different from each other but they all contain the same
        basic parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The seeds develop from the ovule in the ovary of the flower of the plant. A drawing of a seed is shown below.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img class="img-centered" src="crosssectionofseed_BRM_2.11.21.jpg" width="500" />

      <p>
        Seeds contain the <b>plant embryo</b> (fertilized egg) surrounded by a protective <b>seed coat</b>. 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          The <b>embryo</b> includes (a) a seed leaf (called a <b>"cotyledon",</b> pronounced "kaw-ta-LEE-don"),
          (b) a beginning stem (called a plumule), and (c) a beginning root (called a radicle).
          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>
              The <b>cotyledon</b> leaf in the seed stores food in the form of starch and protein, which is used
              by the seedling for energy to grow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Seed coat</b> (shell): The outer covering of the seed, it is like a hard plastic wrap and
          protects the embryo and its stored food. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The embryo, which develops from a <b>zygote</b>, eventually develops into a seedling (a young plant
        that is just starting to grow above the ground) and then into a mature plant.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div id="page5" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>How are seeds spread around?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeds are spread by gravity, wind, rain, and by animals such as birds, insects and other animals (usually
        by eating the seeds and pooping them out somewhere else).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Germination</b> is when the embryo in a seed grows into a small plant. Germination starts when the seed
        absorbs water &mdash; and begins to use the stored food to grow the embryo &mdash; to when the embryo becomes a small plant
        (or a <u>seedling)</u>. This process is shown in the picture below. Germination may begin as soon as the seed
        is planted or may take years. This depends on factors like (a) the amount of water the seed is exposed to, and
        (b) the amount of oxygen the seed has available to it. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-centered">
        <b>Germination process</b>
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="PlantGrowth-Beans_BRM_revised_O_final (1).jpg" alt="Plant Growth" />

      <p>
        The seed needs some water but not enough to drown it. Seeds need some sort of material (e.g., soil) to grow
        in. For seeds to start to germinate, the soil must have the right: 
      </p>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>pH (acidity) level,</li>
        <li>size and texture of its particles</li>
        <li>amount of moisture</li>
        <li>space between the particles of soil.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        They may also need something that helps break apart the seed coat, like an animal stepping or chewing on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To grow into plants, seedlings also need the right amounts of light, nutrients and minerals.
      </p>
