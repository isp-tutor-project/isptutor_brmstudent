        Some materials are better at transferring thermal energy than other materials. You may have noticed that when
        you touch different things in the same room, some feel warmer and others feel cooler. Metals tend to feel
        cooler and other materials, like wood or the carpet, feel warmer (or the same temperature as your hand).

      <p>
        Many people think that this is because they are at different temperatures. But they are actually the same
        temperatures: the temperature of the room they are in, usually about 72 degrees F or 22 degrees C. 
        The reason that some materials feel warmer and other materials feel cooler has to do with the type of
        materials they are: whether they are thermal conductors or thermal insulators.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Thermal conductors.</b> Some materials, including metals, are "thermal conductors." These materials are
        good at transferring thermal energy. When you touch thermal conductors that are at room temperature (72
        degrees F or 22 degrees C),
        <a target="_blank" href="../thermal-energy-heat-temp/index.html"><b>thermal energy</b></a> is transferred
        from your hand (which is at your body temperature, about 98 degrees Fahrenheit or 36.7
        degrees Celsius) to the material. Because your hand loses thermal energy, it feels cooler. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thermal conductors such as metals are good at converting sunlight (solar radiation) to thermal energy
        (molecular motion). This is why when you touch a metal object that has been sitting outside in the sun, it
        feels very hot. It feels hotter than objects that are not thermal conductors (like the grass or a
        picnic blanket).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <b>Thermal insulators.</b> Other materials, like cotton, which is used to make many clothes, are
        "thermal insulators." These materials are not good at transferring thermal energy. So, when you touch
        these materials, little or no thermal energy is transferred from your hand to that material. Because
        your hand does not lose thermal energy, these insulators feel like they are the same temperature as your hand. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one reason why cotton and most clothing materials are thermal insulators. If they were not insulators,
        you would probably feel very cold most of the time because your body would keep losing thermal energy!
      </p>
      <div>Insulating materials like glass, plastic, and Styrofoam are often used for drinking cups. This is because they
        keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. </div>

        The table below shows examples of materials that are better insulators and materials that
        are better conductors of thermal energy:

            You're right! More of the ice cream that is wrapped in aluminum foil will have melted. Aluminum foil is a thermal conductor,
            which means it can "carry" thermal energy. It will "carry" thermal energy from your hand to the ice cream.
            This loss of thermal energy is what makes your hand feel cold! It also brings the thermal energy to the ice
            cream, melting it! (a) is the correct answer.
