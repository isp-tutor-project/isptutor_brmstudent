      <p>
        You may have noticed that when
        you touch different objects in the same room, some feel warmer and others feel cooler. Metals tend to feel
        cooler and other materials, like wood or the carpet, feel warmer (or the same temperature as your hand).
      </p>

     <br/>
      <img alt="conductors, metal and wood" class="img-centered img-size" src="Conductors.jpg" width="800"/>
     <br/>

      <p>
        Many people think that this is because they are at different temperatures. But they are actually the same
        temperatures: the temperature of the room they are in, usually about 72°F or 22°C. 
        The reason that some materials feel warmer and other materials feel cooler has to do with the type of
        materials they are: whether they are thermal conductors or thermal insulators.
      </p>
      <p>Particles (atoms/molecules) that make up metals and other thermal conductors more easily speed up or slow down (remember, atoms and molecules 
        are always moving around at temperatures found on the earth). On the other hand, particles that make up thermal insulators 
        are more resistant to changing speeds when they come in contact with objects at different temperatures. 
      </p>

     <br/>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page2">

      <p>
        <b>Thermal conductors.</b> Some materials, including metals, are "thermal conductors." These materials are
        good at transferring thermal energy. When you touch thermal conductors that are at room temperature (72°F or 22°C),
        <a class="brm-link" href="../thermal-energy-heat-temp/" target="_blank">thermal energy</a> is transferred
        from your hand (which is at your body temperature, about 98°F or 36.7°C) to the material. Because your hand loses thermal energy (that is, the particles that make up the surface of your
        hand lose some of their speed), it feels cooler. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thermal conductors such as metals are also good at converting sunlight (solar radiation) to thermal energy
        (molecular motion). This is why when you touch a metal object that has been sitting outside in the sun, it
        feels very hot. It feels hotter than objects that are not thermal conductors (like the grass or a
        picnic blanket).
      </p>
     <br/>
      <p>
        <b>Thermal insulators.</b> Other materials, like cotton, which is used to make many clothes, are
        "thermal insulators." These materials are not good at transferring thermal energy. So, when you touch
        these materials, little or no thermal energy is transferred from your hand to that material. Because
        your hand does not lose much thermal energy, these insulators feel like they are about the same temperature as your hand. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one reason why cotton and most clothing materials are thermal insulators. If they were not insulators,
        you would probably feel very cold most of the time because your body would keep losing thermal energy!
      </p>
      <div>Insulating materials like glass, plastic, and Styrofoam are often used for drinking cups. This is because they
        keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. </div>
