      <p>
        <b>What is Friction?</b> Friction is a force between a surface and an object moving on that surface that resists
          motion. In other words, the force of friction acts in the direction that is opposite the direction the object is
          moving on a surface. This idea is shown below, where a person pushes on a box to the right. The force of friction acts 
          on the box in the opposite direction (to the left):

     <br/>
      <p>
        <b>Why do we care about friction?</b> Friction is another very important force that allows you to walk,
        ride your bike, or drive to where you want to go. Without friction, we'd slide off of our chairs and slip
        trying to walk! It would be as if every surface were as slippery as the most slippery ice!

        <i><b>Example 1.</b></i> You have probably noticed that it's much easier to push a box on a wooden floor than on a
          carpeted floor. This is because there is more friction that opposes the motion of the box on the carpeted floor
          than on the smoother wooden floor.
      </p>

    </div>

<div class="page" id="page4">

 <p>
        <b><i>Example 2</i></b>. For example, when you walk barefoot, you may feel the friction between the bottom
        of your foot and the ground surface. When you first take a step and push forward on the ground
        (See #1 in the picture below), this friction force acts on your foot in the opposite direction you are
        walking in. The amount of the force of friction acting on your foot is also the <i>same</i> as the force
        your foot applies to the ground. This balance of forces keeps your foot from sliding forward on the ground.
        But if you stepped on a banana, the backward friction force would be much less. As a result, your foot would
        slide forward, in the direction of the net force acting on your foot (and you may fall!).
      </p>

<div>
      <img alt="image of applied action and friction reaction" class="img-centered img-size_med" src="FrictionFeetGraphicA3-T1RevisedText.jpg"/>
</div>
      <br/>
      <p>
        So, this shows how the friction between the ground and the bottom of your foot is necessary to keep
        your foot from sliding forward when you first take a step. This happens because friction pushes against the
        bottom of your foot in the opposite direction that you are pushing against the ground. The amount of the
        force of friction acting on your foot is also the <i>same</i> as the force your foot applies to the ground. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown in #3, friction also allows you to push off backward on the ground and allow you to move
        forward. Friction acts in the opposite direction of your push on the ground, or forward this time.
        If there were less or no friction (for example, if you stepped on another banana), your foot would
        slide backwards and you may fall (again!).
      </p>
      <br/>
      </div>

<div class="page" id="page5">
      <p>
        <b><i>Example 3</i>.</b> For a round object to roll down an incline (such as a hill),
          there must be at least some friction between the object and surface of the incline. If
            there is no friction, the object will not roll. Instead, it will slide down the incline. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Effect of friction on sliding vs. rolling objects.</b> The amount of friction between a round object
        (for example, a ball) and surface determines whether the object will slide or roll on the surface (for
        example, a ramp). 
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is no or little friction, the object will slide down the surface. This is represented in the picture below.
      
        For <b>sliding objects</b>, greater friction produces more resistance to the object's motion. 
      </p>

      <img alt="ball rolling uphill" class="img-centered img-size_smaller" src="friction2ball_clarified.jpg"/>
      <br/>

      <p>
        If there is enough friction acting on the round object (as shown below), it will start to <b>roll</b> down the surface.
        This is what we see happen most of the time.
      </p>

      

     <br/>
      <img alt="ball rolling downhill" class="img-centered img-size_smaller" src="NewFrictionBall_final.jpg"/>
     <br/>

      <p>
        Once there is enough friction to keep the rolling object rolling
              (and not slipping or sliding at all on the surface), increasing the friction does not affect the rolling object's motion. In other
              words, once friction is greater than a certain amount, adding more friction does not affect the ball's motion.

        <b>Friction and speed of ball on ramp.</b> As discussed more in 
        <a class="brm-link" href="../kinetic-and-potential-energy/" target="_blank">Kinetic and Potential Energy</a> 
        (advanced section), there are several types of kinetic energy (KE). One type is translational KE, which is
        the energy due to the movement of the object across a distance (for example, a ball sliding down a ramp).
        The faster an object moves, the greater its translational KE is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another type of KE is rotational KE. This is the energy due to an object's rotation around
        an axis. The faster the object rotates, the greater its rotational KE is. Both types of motion are shown in the
        animation below:

            The animation above shows a ball rolling down a ramp. The ball has two types of motion: (a) translational motion (moving along the x-axis, and (b) rotational
            motion (rotating along its own axis).

          That's right! If the ball slides rather than rolls, it will only have translational kinetic energy. So, based on the conservation
          of energy, it will have more translational kinetic energy than a ball that is rolling down the same ramp (which
          has both translational and rotational kinetic energy). So, the sliding ball will be moving faster down the ramp
          (at every location on the ramp).
