        <b>Relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.</b> The acceleration of an object (in a given direction)
        is caused by (a) the net force acting on the object in that direction and (b) the mass of the object. This is
        Newton's second law. If the net force acting on an object in a direction is zero, then the object's
        acceleration in that direction would also be zero. You can easily check for yourself by plugging zero in for
        the net force into

          Right! The object is moving in the horizontal direction.
          The only forces acting on the object are in the vertical direction.
          So, there are no forces acting on the body in the horizontal direction. Because of this, the body's acceleration in the horizontal direction will be zero.
          This means that the object's velocity (or speed in this direction) will not change.

        If the net force acting on the object in a given direction is not equal to zero, the object's speed will
        change, or it will accelerate, in that direction <i>for as long as the force acts on the object</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><b>Example 1.</b></i> Force A (10 Newtons) acts on an object-that is initially at rest-in the horizontal
        direction. Because the object is on an ice surface, there is no friction acting on the object. So, the only
        force acting on the object in the horizontal direction is Force A. The force is constant (meaning it does not
        change; it is always 10 N) and keeps acting on the object all the way across the ice (to after Point D, shown
        below). So, the speed of the object will keep increasing all the way across the ice. It will be slowest
        at Point A, faster at Point B, still faster at Point C and fastest at Point D.
      </p>


      <img alt="image showing speed of object over time" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="ForceAtPoints.png"/>

      <p>
        Because the object was pushed by a constant force (10 N) all the way across the ice, the acceleration of the
        object will also be constant (or will not change). A constant acceleration means that every second, the
        object's speed will increase by the same amount. If the object had a mass of 2 kg, then its acceleration would
        be 5 m/s<sup>2</sup> (because, applying Newton's Second Law, 10 N divided by 2 kg is 5 m/s<sup>2</sup>). 
        This means that every second the force acts on the object, its speed increases by 5 m/s. This constant
        acceleration of 5 m/s<sup>2</sup> is shown in the graph below. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Reminder: If the net force acting on an object in a given direction is not equal to zero, the object will accelerate 
        in that direction <i>for as long as the force acts on the object</i>.
      </p>

      <img alt="image showing speed of object over time" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="ForceAtPoints.png"/>
      <p>
        But, the moment the net force in that direction is zero, <i>the object will no longer accelerate in that direction</i>. 
        So, in Example 1 (shown above),
        if Force A stops acting on the object at Point C, the object would also stop accelerating at Point C.
