        <span class="font-verdana"><b>What is the buoyancy force?</b> You have probably noticed that some
          objects sink in water and other objects float. We say that objects that float are “buoyant." </span>
        Why do some objects sink while others float? The answer has to do with the <b>upward force of water acting
          on objects in the water,</b> called the "buoyancy" force.

        <b>Summary of buoyancy force: when objects float versus sink</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a nutshell, the buoyancy force acting on an object in water is caused by the water molecules moving around
        and bumping into and pushing on the object. This water pressure causes an upward force on the object. This
        idea is shown in the picture below.
      </p>
      <a href="../buoyancy/Boat_Water.GIF?attredirects=0/index.html">
        <img class="img-centered img-size_med" src="Boat_Water.GIF"/>
      </a>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Applying 
        <a class="brm-link" href="../forces-and-motion-newton-s-second-law/" target="_blank">Newton's Second Law,</a>
        when the force of water pushing up on the boat is equal to the weight of the boat, the boat will float on
        the water. When the weight of the boat is greater than the force of water pushing up on the boat, the boat
        will sink. (If the force of the water pushing up on the boat is greater than the weight of the boat, the boat
        will rise up in the water until the forces balance out. The boat will then float on the water.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Newton's Second law, we can also predict if something sinks or floats based on whether it is more or
        less dense than water. The density of water is about 1 gram/cm<sup>3</sup>. We can figure out the density
        of the object by dividing its mass by its volume. 
      </p>
      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          If the density of the object is less than the density of the water, the object will float.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the density of the object is greater than the density of the water, the object will sink.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the case of the boat above, the density of the boat is less than the density of water
        (1 gram/cm<sup>3</sup>). So, it floats!

        <b>Conceptual explanation of buoyancy force.</b> To understand the buoyancy force, we need to remember that
        water molecules
        in a liquid state are kind of like slippery marbles that slither around each other. But the water molecules
        can't get much closer to each other. So we can think of water as a solid to understand buoyancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important thing to remember is that as we go deeper below the surface of water, the water pressure
        increases. This means that the water pushes harder (in all directions) the deeper you go under water.
        The reason for this is just that there is more weight of water to hold up the deeper we go. If somehow there
        was no water below a certain depth and you had to hold up the water above it, you'd need to push up harder
        when there is more water above you. This is shown below.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img alt="depth_below_water_surface" class="img-centered img-size_700" src="GoodPressureDepth2.PNG"/>

      <p>
        This means that the water is also pushing down on you more when the water is deeper (due to
        <a class="brm-link" href="../newton-s-third-law/" target="_blank">Newton's Third Law</a>
        ). Water molecules are pushing harder in every direction the deeper the water is!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, when you put, for example, a cube-shaped object in water, the moving water molecules will push on the
        object from all sides. But the pressure on the sides of the object cancels out. For example, the amount
        of pressure on the left side of the object is equal to the amount of pressure on the right side of the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the pressures from the water on the top and bottom sides of the cube are not equal. There is more
        pressure on the bottom of the cube than on the top of the cube. Because of this difference in pressure,
        the total or “net” pressure from the water molecules is <b>upward</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This upward pressure on the object causes the upward force we call the “buoyancy” force. The buoyancy
        force is caused by pressure from the surrounding water molecules, which results in an upward force on
        an object in water.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>The strength of the UPWARD buoyancy force on an object in water is equal to the weight of the
          water that the object displaced. </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is the upward buoyancy force equal to the weight of the volume of water displaced by the object? In
        the picture above, the dotted lines indicate the volume of water that will be taken up
        by—or displaced by—the object. Because that segment of water is not accelerating up or down, the downward
        force of gravity on that segment of water is equal to the upward buoyancy force. Now, when that volume of
        water is displaced by an object, the water molecules still behave the same way, and will exert the same
        upward pressure/force on that object. So, the upward buoyancy force on the object remains the same, equal
        to the weight of the water displaced by the object. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The strength of the UPWARD buoyancy force on an object in water is equal to the weight of the water that
          the object displaced.</b> Like all motion, according to
        <a class="brm-link" href="../forces-and-motion-newton-s-second-law/" target="_blank">Newton's Second Law</a>
        , the net force on an object in a given direction (in this case, the vertical direction or up/down) will
        determine the motion (i.e., acceleration) of the object:
      </p>
      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          If the object's weight is greater than the upward buoyancy force (the weight of the water it displaced),
          the object will sink in the water. For the object's weight to be greater than the weight of the (same volume
          of) water it displaced, the object must have more mass than the (same volume of) water it displaced. <b>That
            is, the object must be <i>denser</i> than the water for it to sink</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the object's weight is less than the upward buoyancy force (the weight of the water it displaced), the
          object will rise in the water. For the object's weight to be less than the weight of the (same volume of)
          water it displaced, the object must have less mass than the (same volume of) water it displaced. 
          <b>That is, the object must be <i>less dense</i> than the water for it to rise in the water</b>.

        <b>Mathematical summary of buoyancy force: When an object will rise vs. sink in water</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The equation for the <span style="color:#9900ff">initial</span> acceleration of an object
        <span style="color:#9900ff">initially at rest</span> in water only depends on the <i>density</i> of
        the object. This equation** is shown below, where "<b>g</b>" is the acceleration due to gravity
        (about 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> downward on Earth). In this equation, a positive value for acceleration means
        that the object is rising upward in the water, and a negative value means that the object is accelerating
        downward in the water.
      </p>

      <br/>
      <img alt="acceleration_equation" class="img-centered" src="Eqn1_water_no8.JPG" width="550"/>

      <p>
        Once the object starts moving in the water, a drag force from the water also acts on the object (click 
        <a class="brm-link" href="../forces-on-object-moving-in-fluid/" target="_blank">here</a>
        for more information about drag forces, including the effect of an object's shape on the drag force). But we
        will keep it simple in this unit and ignore that force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether the object accelerates upward or downward depends on the ratio of the density of water to the density
        of the object. If this ratio is greater than 1 (or the density of water is greater than the density of the
        object), the acceleration will be upward (positive). If the ratio of the density of water to the density of
        the object is less than one (or the density of the object is greater than the density of water), the
        acceleration of the object will be downward (negative).

      <p>
        <b>To summarize Equation #1:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the object is <b>less dense</b> than water, it will have a positive acceleration. This means that is
        will initially accelerate upward (and rise in the water):

      <br/>
      <p>
        If the object is <b>more dense</b> than water, it will have a negative acceleration. This means that it

        This equation is true for any fluid (not just water). The general form of this equation is shown below:
      </p>

      <img alt="aceleration_equation" class="img-centered" src="Eqn1_general_no8.JPG" width="550"/>

      <p>
        For any object to initially accelerate upward (and float) in any fluid, it must be less dense than the

      <br/>

      <p>
        And for any object to initially accelerate downward (and sink) in any fluid, it must be more dense
        than the fluid:

        <b>Note:</b> It is very important to be careful about signs in your equations! If you are not careful, the
        equations will not be accurate!

        Replacing "Net force" with the forces of weight and buoyancy (above), we have:

      <p>
        Dividing both sides of the equation by the mass of the object, we get:

        The densities of various material are known and can be looked up (e.g., see the density table in the
        <a class="brm-link" href="../density/" target="_blank">Density unit</a>).
        The density of objects does not depend on the object’s size, and it is easier to look up the densities of
        materials than to weigh the objects and calculate their masses!
        <i>So, we will substitute masses in the equations above with densities.</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        The mass of an object is equal to the density of the object times its volume:
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="MassVolumeDensityEqn.JPG" width="350"/>

      <p>
        So, we can re-write the equation <span style="color:#0070c0">(#5)</span> in terms of density and volume:
      </p>

      <img class="img-centered" src="Eqn6_NEWUSE.JPG" width="500"/>

      <p>
        We know that the volume of displaced water is equal to the volume of the object. So, the volume terms
        cancel out:

        (As a reminder, this is the initial acceleration of an object initially at rest in water. Only the downward
        force of gravity and an upward buoyancy force act on the object at first.)
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        If the initial acceleration of the object is zero, it does not accelerate downward or upward.
        <b>This happens when the density of the object is equal to the density of the water</b>:
