    <h1>Factors Affecting Photosynthesis</h1>

    <div id="page1" class="page">
      <p>
        <b>Variables that affect the rate of photosynthesis:</b> There are several factors that affect the rate of
        photosynthesis (or how fast sugars are produced in plants). These include: (a) light intensity (brightness),
        (b) carbon dioxide concentration, (c) temperature, and (d)
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../light/index.html">light wavelength</a>.
        The relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis is shown in the graph below.

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Light intensity (amount/brightness of light).</b> When there is no light, no photosynthesis takes place. As
          the
          light intensity increases from zero, the rate of photosynthesis
          increases. After a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase any more with increasing
          light intensity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
        <li>
          <p id="demo" style="display: none">This happens because there is just not enough chlorophyll (and other

          You are right. With low levels of light intensity (close to the origin of the graph), as light intensity

          Right! As the CO<sub>2</sub> level increases, the photosynthesis rate also increases. However, once it

          <b>Temperature.</b> The relationship between temperature and rate of photosynthesis
          is different from the others. Again, when the temperature is very low, no photosynthesis
          occurs. The increase in photosynthesis rate is slow at first, but starts to increase
          more quickly at a certain point. The rate of photosynthesis is highest between 10
          and 20 degrees Celsius (or 50-68&deg;F). After this maximum, the photosynthesis
          rate drops off quickly as the temperature increases. At around 40&deg;C (or 104&deg;F), 
          photosynthesis stops. As a result, plants cannot grow anymore.

            <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../chemicalvs-physicalreactions/">chemical reactions</a>.
            Chlorophyll is one enzyme that helps cause photosynthesis. Another enzyme, called RuBisCo, has the job of
            capturing CO<sub>2</sub>. When the temperature is too high, RuBisCo gets very bad at capturing
            CO<sub>2</sub>, which is needed for photosynthesis. As a result, photosynthesis stops.
