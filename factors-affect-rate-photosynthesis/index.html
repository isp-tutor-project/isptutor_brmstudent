        <b>Variables that affect the rate of photosynthesis:</b> There are several factors that affect the rate of
        photosynthesis (or how fast sugars are produced in plants). These include: (a) light intensity (brightness),
        (b) carbon dioxide concentration, (c) temperature, and (d)
        <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../light/index.html">light wavelength</a>.
        The relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis is shown in the graph below. 
      </p>

      <br>

      <div style="text-align:left">
        
          <img
              class="img-centered" src="LightIntensity_PhotosynthRateGraph.GIF" width="400" height="250" />
      
        </a>

      </div>
      <br/>

      <ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Light intensity (amount/brightness of light).</b> When there is no light, no photosynthesis takes place. As the
          <b>light intensity </b>increases from zero, the rate of photosynthesis
          increases. After a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase any more with increasing
          light intensity. This happens because there is just not enough chlorophyll and other chemicals in plant cells to increase
          the rate of photosynthesis any more.
        </li>
        </ul>

</div>

<div id="page2" class="page">

<ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Carbon Dioxide concentration.</b> When there is no CO<sub>2</sub>, photosynthesis does not occur.
          Increasing the concentration of <b>Carbon Dioxide</b> will increase the rate of photosynthesis. But after
          a certain point, the rate of photosynthesis will not increase any more as CO<sub>2</sub>
          concentration increases. 
        </li>
        </ul>

        <img class="img-centered" src="CO2_RatePhotoSynth_Graph.GIF" width="400" height="251" />

<br>So, after a certain point, more carbon dioxide in the air will no longer help plants grow.

</div>

<div id="page3" class="page">


<ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
            <b>Temperature.</b> The relationship between temperature and rate of photosynthesis
            is different from the others. Again, when the temperature is very low, no photosynthesis
            occurs. The increase in photosynthesis rate is slow at first, but starts to increase
            more quickly at a certain point. The rate of photosynthesis is highest between 10
            and 20 degrees Celsius (or 50-68 degrees F). After this maximum, the photosynthesis
            rate drops off quickly as the temperature increases. At around 40 degrees C (or 104
            degrees F), photosynthesis stops. As a result, plants cannot grow anymore.

            <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
              <li>
                Why does photosynthesis stop at high temperatures? There are certain molecules called "enzymes" made
                by living organisms. Enzymes speed up
                <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../chemicalvs-physicalreactions/">chemical reactions</a>.
                Chlorophyll is one enzyme that helps cause photosynthesis. Another enzyme, called RuBisCo, has the job of
                capturing CO<sub>2</sub>. When the temperature is too high, RuBisCo gets very bad at capturing
                CO<sub>2</sub>, which is needed for photosynthesis. As a result, photosynthesis stops.
              </li>
            </ul>

        </li>

</div>

<div id="page4" class="page">

<ul class="brm-list">
        <li>
          <b>Light wavelength.</b> Certain
          <a class="brm-link" target="_blank" href="../light/">frequencies of visible light</a> 
          speed up or slow the rate of photosynthesis. Sunlight that has energy in the blue-violet and red frequency
          ranges causes the highest rates of photosynthesis. Sunlight in the green range causes lower rates of
          photosynthesis. This is because chlorophyll pigment molecules do not absorb green light well* (and do not
          convert this radiation into energy that causes the chemical processes in photosynthesis). 

          <ul class="brm-list nested-list">
            <li>*This is why plants' leaves look green to us: green light is not absorbed; instead,
              it is reflected away by the molecules that make up the plants.
