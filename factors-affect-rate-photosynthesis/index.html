        <a class="brm-link" href="../light/index.html" target="_blank">light wavelength</a>.

          <b>Temperature.</b> The relationship between temperature and rate of photosynthesis
          is different from the others. Again, when the temperature is very low, no photosynthesis
          occurs. The increase in photosynthesis rate is slow at first, but starts to increase
          more quickly at a certain point. The rate of photosynthesis is highest between 10
          and 20°C (or 50-68°F). After this maximum, the photosynthesis
          rate drops off quickly as the temperature increases. At around 40°C (or 104°F), 
          photosynthesis stops. As a result, plants cannot grow anymore.

            Chlorophyll is one enzyme that helps cause photosynthesis. Another enzyme, called RuBisCo, has the job of
            capturing CO<sub>2</sub>. When the temperature is too high, RuBisCo gets very bad at capturing
            CO<sub>2</sub>, which is needed for photosynthesis. As a result, photosynthesis stops.
