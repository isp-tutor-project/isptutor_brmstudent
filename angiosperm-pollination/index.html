        style='background-color:transparent'> <b>What do bees do to help plant reproduction by pollination? </b>Plant reproduction depends to some extent on animals.
        For angiosperms--plants with flowers that produce seeds--animals play a key role in reproduction. </span><span
        style='background-color:transparent'>Bees (as well as other insects and birds) are attracted
        to the colorful petals of flowers and the nectar produced by plants. Nectar is a sugary,
        protein-rich liquid that is produced by a group of cells called the “nectary”. Nectaries
        can be inside the flowers (as shown in the picture below) or outside the flowers (e.g., at
        the base of leaves below the petals). 
        
        <br><br>
        
        <b><i>Nectaries inside flowers. </i></b>Nectaries that are inside the flowers help plant reproduction
        by releasing nectar. Nectar attracts visitors such as bees and other insects, and birds. </span></p>

              border='0' /></div><br/>
        </div>
        
            <div style='display:block;text-align:left'>As bees or other visitors push their bodies through the flowers to get the nectar, they
              accidentally brush against the stamens and the pollen from the anther sticks to their
              body (as shown below). As they move to the next plant, they carry this pollen.
              Some pollen may be transferred to the stigma of the flower, where it may tunnel down
              the stigma to fertilize an egg cell inside the ovary. (After the egg is fertilized, it
              becomes a seed). (See the <a target='_blank' href='../angiosperm-reproduction/index.html'><b><font
                    color='#0000ff'>Angiosperm Reproduction</font></b></a> unit for more details.) 
                    
              <br><br>      
                    
              This method of moving pollen from one flower to another for reproduction is called “pollination”.
              The visitors searching for nectar are accidental pollinators. For example, bees happen
              to go to the same type (species) of flower during a foraging (food collecting) trip.
              This behavior helps the reproduction of this species by pollination of its flowers. </div>

      <div><span style='background-color:transparent'>The picture of the bee above shows how bees can
          collect quite a bit of pollen on their bodies while foraging for food. So, we can imagine
          how much pollen just one bee can help to share between flowers. In fact, there are several
          species of plants that depend on pollinators such as honey bees for reproduction. These
          include kiwis, watermelon, cantaloupe, and macadamia plants. Honey bees are one pollinator
          of sunflowers as well.</span></div>
      <br/>
      <div><b><i>Nectaries outside flowers. </i></b>Nectaries can also be located outside of the flowers (e.g., at the base of leaves and on
      stems). These external nectaries do not promote pollination but instead protect the plants.
      For example, visitors (such as wasps) come to these plants for the nectar. They protect the
      precious nectar by scaring away predators that eat the plants (like caterpillars). </div>

      <div><span style='background-color:transparent'><br/>
        </span></div>
      <div>Honey bees use their long, straw-like tongues (proboscis-es) to suck the sugary and protein
        rich liquid called nectar, into their “honey stomach”. The honey stomach is actually not
        a “regular” stomach, but it is part of their throat (a pipe called esophagus). This pipe
        expands to store the nectar. To fill this honey stomach, honey bees visit over 100 flowers. </div>
      <div><br/>
      </div>
      <div>The nectar that a bee collects can weigh as much as the bee itself! So, you may see bees that
        are having a hard time flying due to all the pollen attached to them and all the nectar they
        collected. Once a honey bee fills its honey stomach with nectar, it is ready to go home to
        its family, called the “colony”. There, the honey-making process begins.</div> </p>

    <div id="page3" class="page">
<p>
    <div>After a honey bee sucks nectar into its honey "stomach",<span style='background-color:transparent'> special
        enzymes break down the complex sugars in the nectar into smaller components. Two things
        can happen to these smaller sugars: they are either (a) digested as food by that bee or
        (b) are stored for later use in honeycombs (shown in the picture below). Bees in the colony
        also remove some of the water from the nectar to make it very thick. They do this by working
        together to fan their wings to keep the right temperature and to move water vapor out of
        the hive. </span></div>
    <div><span style='background-color:transparent'><br/></span></div>
    <div><span style='background-color:transparent'>Finished honey is a thick substance that has less
        water than the nectar and has smaller, less complex sugars than the nectar. When the honey
        is done, bees close the cells of the honeycombs with wax called beeswax. This beeswax protects
        the honey until bees can use it for food in the future. A colony of bees may need to eat
        between 1 and 200 pounds of honey each year.</span></div>

          <p><div><b>How do honey bees know which flower to visit and which is empty of nectar?</b></div>
            <div><b><br/>
              </b></div>
            <div>Have you ever seen bees just hovering around flowers but not going inside? New research
              shows that bees are able to detect which flower was already visited and thus may be empty
              of nectar. They tend to avoid those flowers. This all has to do with a process called “static
              electricity” caused by <a target='_blank' href='../electric-force/index.html'><b><font
                    color='#0000ff'>electric forces</font></b></a>.</div>
            <div><br/>
            </div>
            <div>When you drag your feet on a carpet, electrons are transferred from the carpet to your
              feet. As a result, your body has a slight negative charge. When you touch an object that
              has a less negative charge (or positive charge), you transfer electrons to that object. A
              similar thing happens to flowers and bees.</div>
            <div><br/>

              <br/>
            </div>

            <div>Bees and other things that fly through air lose electrons. As a result, they become positively
              charged. Similarly, when bees flutter their wings around flowers, a positive charge is created
              on their bodies. Flowers, and pollen inside the flowers, have a weak negative charge. So,
              when the bee visits the flowers, this charge difference pulls the pollen to the bee. The
              pollen sticks to the tiny hairs on the bee’s body. After a bee visit, the flower’s charge
              changes from negative to slightly positive. Bees can detect this slightly positive charge
              and avoid the flowers that were recently visited by others. </div>

                  Right! When bees fly, they lose electrons and become slightly positively charged. A recently-visited flower also has a slightly positive charge. 
                  Because like charges repel each other, the flower and bee would repel each other.

              <div class="feedback-incorrect feedback">
                  Actually, when bees fly, they lose electrons and become slightly positively charged. A recently-visited flower also has a slightly positive charge. 
                  Because like charges repel each other, the flower and bee would repel each other.

              <p><b>What type of food do honey bees collect during a foraging trip?</b>
                <div>
                Just like people, honey bees need variety in their diet. Honey bees need water, sugars,
                  proteins, vitamins, and minerals. We know honey bees collect nectar and make honey.  But
                  did you know that bees also eat the pollen from flowers that sticks to their bodies (shown below)? Though nectar does have a little bit of protein,
                  pollen is much richer in protein than nectar. Bees also feed their
                  queen bee pollen; the queen needs this energy to produce and lay eggs.</div>
